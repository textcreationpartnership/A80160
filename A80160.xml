         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The firſt contains two or thee Sermons preached by one Mr. <hi>T. Marſhall</hi> on <hi>Matth</hi> 22.8. As I diſcern in him a ſpirit which from any Sober man deſerves rather flight than anſwer from thoſe ill favoured paſſages, p. 21. where he char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth us with ſequeſtring, <hi>firſt, the bodily bread from the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors and then the bread of Chriſt from the peoples ſouls.</hi> And page 25. where he hath this paſſage, Mr. <hi>Calvin and his fellowes whom the Presbyterian Reformadoes follow, perceiving what a jewel of auricular confeſſion they have loſt,</hi> &amp;c. Chriſtians! this ſame diſpiſed Mr. <hi>Calvin,</hi> was one whoſe name will live and ſmell ſweet when Mr. <hi>Thomas Marſhalls</hi> will rot (it is a name too well known in the Church of Chriſt for Mr. <hi>Marſhall</hi> to Ecclipſe) but I ſay as theſe and many other ridiculous paſſages, ſheweth me at firſt view what the author was, and how unworthy of an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; So ſome others, (which I ſtumbled upon at firſt) aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me I ſhould find nothing in him worth the anſwering? wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs his diviſion of thoſe words, <hi>The wedding is ready,</hi> into <hi>the wedding</hi> and the <hi>Propenſity</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>But to paſs by that, and much other pittiful ſtuff (ſet out a little (like an old ruſty ſuit) with an end or two of gold and ſilver lace taken our of the Fathers,

            <p>In his 14. page he would make us believe, That the <hi>Feast meant chiefly</hi> Matt. 22. is <hi>The Lords Supper;</hi> and to prove this, he cites <hi>Origen</hi> in the Margent, who by his own confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, onely ſaith it may be ſtretched to that (and all that know any thing of <hi>Origen,</hi> know he had a trick of ſtretching Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphors too far.)

            <p>It was an hundred to one, that in the 15. page Mr. <hi>Marſhall</hi> had not brought in <hi>Christmaſs Feaſts into this Text,</hi> which would have been a New Argument for Chriſtmaſs day, and worthy of ſuch a Doctor, and then he might have proved from Scripture, that it is his and our duty to invite men to a Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſs Py.

            <p>In his 31. page he pretends to anſwer a ſecond Argument of ours drawn from the Miniſters danger participating with the ſins of others. As to what he ſaies upon this point, paſſing by his gird about the Covenant, he tells us the damnation mentioned 1 Cor. 11.29. <hi>Is not to the giver, but to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what is this to the purpoſe, if in giving we <hi>do partake of the ſins of others,</hi> there is a damnation alſo will attend our giving it, and ſurely there is a guilt may be contracted by a participation of the ſins of others, otherwiſe the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle forgot himſelf in warning us we ſhould take heed of it, and the Schoolmen have ſpent their time ill to tell us how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny waies it may be incurred. The queſtion is, whether the Miniſter giving the Sacrament to the unworthy, incurs this guilt;
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Page</hi> 31.</note> if Mr. <hi>M.</hi> thinks he doth not, let him ſpeak out and we will join iſſue with him upon that. He ſaies we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to give it, but he hath not proved it by <hi>Luke</hi> 22.19.</p>
            <p>He thinks he hath nicked it by a diſtinction of cooperati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; he ſaies the Miniſter doth onely cooperate to the ſinners ſin in receiving <hi>in actu primo,</hi> not <hi>in acti ſecundo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. If this diſtinction will ſerve the turn, it will excuſe giving it to Turks.</p>

            <p n="2">2. But we muſt tell him that the <hi>actus primus</hi> is ſin; It is ſin for an ignorant ſcandalous perſon to receive.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I do not well underſtand what Mr. <hi>Marſhall</hi> means by the <hi>actus ſecundus;</hi> if he ſaies his receiving <hi>ſinfully</hi> is <hi>actus ſecundus,</hi> I cannot underſtand how his ſinfulneſs can make a diſtinct act: if he means <hi>receiving damnation,</hi> this indeed may more properly be ſo called, but then he that by giving to him contributes to the cauſe, doth doubtleſs contribute to the effect; for ſurely if he be <hi>cauſa cauſae</hi> he muſt be alſo <hi>cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa cauſati.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He thinks our third Argument from the <hi>ſcandal of godly Communicants is invalid.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. Becauſe he conceives it is not <hi>ſcandalum datum</hi> (a ſcandal given) but only taken; but we deny both theſe we find no ſuch command.</p>

            <p>The conſequence is falſe, and 1. will conclude for receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heathens to the Sacrament.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Nothing muſt be done in Gods worſhip, but what he hath appointed; he hath appointed the word to be preached to all; but he hath not appointed the Sacraments for all.</p>

            <p n="1">1. The conſequence is feeble; for admit there were the ſame danger upon the one or the other, yet the praerequiſite duties are not the ſame, through an inability to perform which, thoſe who are ſounable are to be excluded.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I doubt whether either the ſin of <hi>unworthy hearing,</hi> or the danger be ſo great as the ſin, and danger of unworthy receiving. There are degrees of ſin; I know not how we ſhould better judge the greatneſs of ſin than by Scripture ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions: The Scripture ſaith, He who eateth and drinketh unworthily, <hi>eateth and drinketh damnation to himſelf, and is guilty of the body and blood of Chriſt;</hi> it is made equall to the ſin of <hi>Judas,</hi> which ſurely was greater than the ſin of <hi>Peter</hi> in denying his Maſter. For the danger, 'tis true in <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itu,</hi> the danger of both is the ſame; but it ſeems God is quicker in judgement with ſuch as by unworthy receiving the Sacrament trample under foot the blood of Chriſt; for this cauſe (ſaith the Apoſtle) ſome of you are <hi>ſick</hi> and <hi>weak,</hi> and <hi>ſome are fallen aſleep.</hi> The Scripture ſaith, <hi>Blood-thirsty and deceitful men ſhall not live out half their dayes.</hi> This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes Bloodthirſtineſs of more dangerous conſequence than other ſins.</p>

            <p>At once to ſhew the Vanity of this opinion (which ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails in the world) that the Sacrament <hi>is a converting Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</hi>

            <p n="1">1. <hi>If it be ſo, then it is proper and conſonant to Scripture to go amongst heathens, and as ſoon as we come, call them to a Sacrament in order to their converſion, as to preach the Gospel to them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſurely none ever thought ſo, nor was it ever practiſed in the world yet; what it may be if theſe principles be well practiſed, I cannot tell.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Again, if it be a converting Ordinance, there can be no <hi>perſonal unworthineſs</hi> ſufficient to debar any from it; then come <hi>Turks, Indians, Papiſts, Incestuous perſons,</hi> excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate perſons, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If it be a converting Ordinance, I ſee no reaſon why the Communicant ſhould be bound to examine himſelf, and ſo eat, or whether he hath skill to diſcern the Lords body. But to anſwer diſtinctly.</p>
            <p n="1">1. When we ſpeak of <hi>converting Ordinances,</hi> we mean <hi>Appointments</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt for the converſion of ſouls to himſelf, diſtinguiſhing betwixt thoſe things which may be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>ex accidente</hi> to convince and convert, and what <hi>ex inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuto</hi> is deſigned to that end. Hearing of the word is ſuch, <hi>Faith comes by hearing,</hi> Rom. 10. <hi>Hear and your ſouls ſhall live,</hi> Iſaiah 55.

               </gap> the word of <hi>Inſtitution</hi> at a Sacrament is another thing; let Mr. <hi>Barksdale</hi> prove the latter appointed by Chriſt for converſion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Either the word alone (read at the adminiſtration) is a converting Ordinance, or the Word and Elements making up the Sacrament. If it be only the word, wicked men (for ought I know) may ſtay and hear that; if he ſayes more, he muſt prove it.</p>

               </note> 
               <hi>a private Christian of Great Bowden</hi> in <hi>Lieceſterſhire.</hi> It is properly directed as an
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:118834:11"/>anſwer to Dr. <hi>Drake.</hi> I ſhall not take that learned mans work out of his hand, knowing how able he is to do it himſelf; yet (craving firſt pardon of the Doctor) now my hand is in, I ſhall ſubjoin an animadverſion or two; eſpecially upon ſuch paſſages in his book as contain the principles on which his whole diſcourſe is built, and where he ſpeaks <hi>in theſi</hi> to the buſineſs.</p>
            <p>The Authors ſtudy ſeems to be to beget in his Reader an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of his moderation, upon which he is ſomething fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with the Doctor for ſome <hi>harſh expreſſions</hi> (as he calls them p. 1.) <hi>words that might have been ſpared</hi> (he ſaith) p. 2. he calls it <hi>unbrotherly and uncharitable dealing; Qui alterum incuſat probri, ipſum ſe intueri oportet.</hi> This had been capable of a very good interpretation, if Mr. <hi>Timſon,</hi> had taken as much notice of his friend Mr. <hi>Humfreys</hi> (I had almoſt ſaid) brutiſh reflections upon the Doctor, and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Scripture to do it (witneſs the two laſt pages of his <hi>Rejoinder;</hi> and that vein of Security which runs through the whole book (to paſs by his falſe and imperfect propoſals of the Doctors anſwer, that he might have advantage to ſcoff him; and all this is prefaced in with ſuch humble profeſſions of ſelf-denyal and piety, as are more then ordinary) I ſay if Mr. <hi>Timſon</hi> had equally taken notice of this too, he might have been judged more unbiaſſed then we can now conceive him; eſpecially conſidering his own reflections upon the poor Presbyterians p. 8, 9. whom he chargeth with ſetting up <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers in the Church whom Chriſt never impowred with the keyes, &amp;c. and ſuch a way as no word doth warrant;</hi> and cauſing a careleſs <hi>forbearance of the Sacrament,</hi> and ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding perſons upon accounts <hi>for which thers not the leaſt war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant either of Rule or Preſident,</hi> and <hi>making excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation both leſs, and more than it is,</hi> and doing many things.

Tis well he mends it with <hi>I think;</hi> for we hope we are able to make learned men <hi>think otherwiſe,</hi> or elſe deny both Scripture and Reaſon too.</p>
            <p>Theſe are heavy charges and argue as <hi>unbrotherly and uncharitable dealings,</hi> with ſome hundreds of men in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as learned and judicious as Mr. <hi>Timſon</hi> complains of in
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:118834:11"/>the Doctor, eſpecially conſidering there is (beſides many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) a book written in Mr. <hi>Timſons</hi> mother tongue too, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Jus divinum Regiminis Eccleſiaſtici</hi> with a <hi>Vindication of it,</hi> publiſhed by ſome learned Brethren of the Province of <hi>London,</hi> proving (paſt Mr. <hi>Timſons</hi> anſwering) thoſe ſame offenſive officers and that ſame unwarrantable way, and ſuſpenſion. But thus much onely to let the Reader know that as Mr. <hi>Timſon</hi> is much Mr. <hi>Humfries</hi> friend, ſo he hath imitated him a little too far in quarrelling with his brother for what himſelf intended to be ten times more guilty of.</p>
            <p>In his fourth page he puts the Queſtion, <hi>Whether all Church-members not rightly excommunicated may come to the Lords Supper;</hi> he is for the <hi>Affirmative;</hi> ſomething larger he is in his principles then Mr. <hi>Humfry</hi> (his friend) who excepts thoſe who are excommunicate <hi>de jure.</hi>

            <p>Mr. <hi>Humfry</hi> and Mr. <hi>Timſon</hi> too except <hi>Infants, perſons diſtracted,</hi> and <hi>drunken perſons.</hi> The Doctor ſaies right, that by the ſame reaſon the <hi>Ignorant and ſcandalous</hi> are to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted: I know Mr. <hi>Humfry</hi> is angry at this and doth not love to hear of it often (whence it is that in his <hi>Rejoinder</hi> he ſo ridiculouſly diſturbs his Reader with dallyings) but to ſpeak to the buſineſs, I demand of Mr. <hi>Humfry,</hi> and his friend Mr. <hi>Timſon,</hi> what it is which gives one right to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I know they will ſay <hi>Church-memberſhip.</hi> I proceed; <hi>Either this alone, or this and ſomething elſe.</hi> If they ſay this alone, it muſt neceſſarily follow that according to their principles then all thoſe who are Church-members have a right to it; for <hi>Quod convenit alicui quà tali</hi> muſt needs <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venire omni tali,</hi> and then <hi>Infants,</hi> and mad men, and d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Many of their arguments will fail,</hi> as I ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve anon. 2. <hi>Some may be ſuſpended.</hi> 3. I muſt <hi>enquire what it is then which joined with Church-memberſhip doth entitle them.</hi> I cannot find Mr. <hi>Humfrey</hi> nor Mr. <hi>Timſon</hi> ſpeaking plainly to this; the latter ſpends time to prove the <hi>ignorant</hi> and <hi>ſcandalous</hi> are more capable then <hi>Infants</hi> and <hi>mad men;</hi> but
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:118834:12"/>he is not clear in telling us wherein their capacity lies: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this that they have more years, which fails in mad men, or in this that they have more wit; if I underſtand them them think they are <hi>in a more capacity to exerciſe their reaſon:</hi> Well then; is this the thing that conjoined with Church-memberſhip, gives all a right to the Sacrament? then it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That all Church-members, who are able to exerciſe their reaſon, ought to be admitted to the Table of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Why are Drunkards then excepted by M. <hi>Timſon</hi> p. 4. (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cep he means only during the time of their drunkenneſs) But if Mr. <hi>Timpſon</hi> remembers, p. 5. he tells us, the Church is to enquire what is <hi>agreeable to the will of God revealed.</hi> So then it being granted both by Mr. <hi>Humfry</hi> and Mr. <hi>Timſon;</hi> that meer <hi>Church-memberſhip</hi> doth not give a plenary right to the Sacrament; for then infants and diſtracted perſons and drunkards muſt not be excepted; we in enquiring what elſe muſt be conjoined with it, muſt have an eye to the will of God revealed.</p>
            <p>And let Mr. <hi>Timſon</hi> ſhew us the leaſt ſhadow of Scripture to prove that a capacity of exerciſing their <hi>reaſon</hi> is that other thing, which ſuperadded to Church-memberſhip, gives a ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary right, and we will be his bond-men.</p>
            <p>In the mean time thus far it is agreed betwixt us, that meer Church-memberſhip doth not give one a right. Then <hi>Mr. Timſon hath granted his question againſt himſelf; for ſome Church-members not rightly excommunicated may not come to the Lords Table.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this then is the queſtion between us, what it is which ſuperadded to Church-memberſhip, which gives only <hi>jus ad rem, haereditarium, et remotum,</hi> muſt give a man <hi>jus in re, aptitudinarium, &amp; proximum,</hi> a plenary full right to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr. Humfry</hi> and <hi>Mr. Timſon,</hi> if I underſtand them, ſay as I ſaid before, a capacity to exerciſe their reaſon; we ſay</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> which works by holineſs.</p>
            <p>Here is the queſtion: by whom ſhall we be tryed? By God and the Country, ſaith the <hi>Malefactor;</hi> by God and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:118834:12"/>the Church ſay we. By God ſpeaking to us in his word, and inabling us by vertue of that candle ſet up in us to fetch true concluſions from ſacred principles, comparing ſpiritual things with ſpiritual.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt I plead againſt their opinion thus;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If a meer capacity to exerciſe reaſon entituleth a Church-member to the Sacrament, than every Church member in ſuch a capacity hath an undoubted right.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This conſequcence ſtands upon ſuch foundation of reaſon, that he who doth not want the capacity mentioned in it muſt confeſs it.</p>
            <p>I aſſume then;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But every Church-member that hath a capacity to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe reaſon, hath not an undoubted right to the Lords Supper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ergo.</p>
            <p>What Mr. <hi>Timſon</hi> thinks I cannot tell; but I am ſure Mr. <hi>Humfry</hi> is almoſt angry with the D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ctor, that he ſhould un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand him of ſuch as of right ought to be excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>Now ſurely it is poſſible that one may be in a capacity to exerciſe reaſon, and yet ſo notoriouſly ſcandalous, that of right he ought to be excommunicated. Suppoſe one had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted inceſt or adultery, and that immediately before a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; ſuch a wretch may be in a capacity to exerciſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, yet ſurely Mr. <hi>Timſon</hi> hath large principles if he thinks ſuch wretches have a plenary right to the Ordinance.</p>
            <p>Let Mr. <hi>Humfry</hi> and Mr. <hi>Timſon</hi> ſay what they can. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing beſides Church-memberſhip muſt be added to give one a plenary right to the Sacrament; or elſe Infants and diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted perſons muſt have a plenary right. And ſomething be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides an ability to exerciſe reaſon; or elſe an inceſtuous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon immediately after his vileneſs hath as full a right as any; and the like might be ſaid for a Drunkard, a Murtherer, any profane perſon, openly defending his profaneſs, for one who doth not know whether Chriſt were a man or a woman, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly I urge further according to Mr. <hi>Timſons</hi> prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</p>
            <pb n="24" facs="tcp:118834:13"/>
            <p>
               <hi>He muſt be able to diſcern the Lords body from common Bread.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But many men may be Church-members and rational, and yet not able to do this.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ergo <hi>ſomething elſe muſt be ſuperadded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. A child of five or ſix years old is able to exerciſe reaſon and is a Church-member if baptized; if theſe two things give a plenary right, ſuch children ought undoubtedly to be admitted.</p>
            <p>This is ſufficient to ſhew the vanity of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, That meer Church-memberſhip, with a capacity to exerciſe Reaſon, gives one a plenary right to the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
            <p>And if meer Church-memberſhip doth not do it, no nor that with this ſecond thing added:</p>
            <p>I Query what it is doth it. Surely it muſt be ſomething above theſe: we ſay a Knowledge of the things of God conjoined with faith in Chriſt, ſuch a faith as is evidenced by holineſs.</p>
            <p>It will ſtand Mr. <hi>Humfrey</hi> and Mr. <hi>Timſon</hi> in hand either to ſpeak clearly to this, and tell us what gives a plenary right, or to acknowledge with us that theſe things (ſuperadded to Church-memberſhip) do: which if they grant us, Let them ſay what they will. Dr. <hi>Drake</hi> ſaith true, that by the ſame reaſon that Mr. <hi>Humfry</hi> and Mr. <hi>Timſon</hi> except infants and perſons diſtracted, ignorant and ſcandalous perſons are to be excepted; and <hi>Mr. Humfrys</hi> excepting out of his opinion infants and perſons diſtracted, is but a crafty trick to prevent thoſe arguments which he foreſaw he could not anſwer, like ſome late <hi>Arminians,</hi> who tell us, <hi>Christ died to purchaſe a poſſibility of ſalvation for all but ſuch as ſhall dy impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the Reader may eaſily perceive the ſores of <hi>M. Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frys</hi> book, by his kickings in his <hi>Rejoinder,</hi> where the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor touched him. I ſay <hi>Mr. Humfry</hi> and <hi>Mr. Timſon</hi> muſt hold that a meer natural capacity to exerciſe reaſon in one who is a Church-member, gives him a full right to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, or elſe there is a <hi>par ratio</hi> for keeping away the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:118834:13"/>and ſcandalous as for infants and perſons diſtracted. And if they hold ſo I have ſhewed them what follows upon it. When Mr. <hi>Timſon</hi> ſpeaks clearly to this point, we will more ſtrictly examine his judgement.</p>
            <p>He ſpends his 8, 9, 10. pages in entering his exceptions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Diſcipline where he chargeth the friends of it ſufficiently, and d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>als as unbrotherly with ſome hundreds of Learned and Reverend men, as he chargeth Dr. <hi>Drake</hi> to have done with Mr. <hi>Humphry,</hi> and ſomething more.</p>
            <p>Conſidering that the Reverend Doctor if he be a little ſmart with his adverſary, yet withall he anſwers his adverſary <hi>Et miſcuit utile amaro.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>Timſon</hi> hath anſwered nothing ſaid in the defence of thoſe practices which he ſo deeply cenſureth. All that I ſhall ſay is, we hope, <hi>Longe aliter in Coelo quam Boudenae de Presbyterio concluſum eſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Jeſus Chriſt and Mr. <hi>Timſon</hi> are not both of a mind. But in the mean time,</p>

            </p>
            <p>As to the firſt of theſe Queries.

            <p n="2">2. Whether every unregenerate man (as unregenerate) be perſonally unworthy, <hi>Mr. Timſon</hi> ſeems to doubt, we believe,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:118834:14"/>but there is no need to diſpute it here. For</p>
            <p n="3">3. We grant that every Church member is by us to be lookt upon as habitually worthy, unleſs by ſome actual miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage he declares himſelf actually unworthy, which we believe may be done as well by his ignorance, diſcovering his actual miſimproving of the means of grace, as by his ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous life and converſation. Yet we believe their Church-memberſhip is not that which makes them habitually wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy but their intereſt in Chriſt, which charity obligeth us to believe they have till by ſome fruits they diſcover to us the contrary.</p>
            <p n="4">4. We dare not deny but the diſorderly eating in the Church of Corinth, was an unworthy eating, and might be a cauſe of their puniſhment <hi>ver.</hi> 30. we know God is very tender of his own order. <hi>God hath made a breach upon us</hi> (ſaith <hi>David</hi> in <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzah</hi>'s caſe) <hi>becauſe we ſought him not in due order.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. But that a man ſhould not be capable of eating un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily, except by ſuch diſorderly receiving? or that all the unworthy eating of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> ſhould be their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly eating; or that this ſhould be the only ſin for which they were puniſhed with death.</p>
            <p>Theſe things we cannot digeſt without ſome good Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to crowd them down.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe the Apoſtle <hi>chap.</hi> 5. had told the <hi>Corinthians</hi> they could not keep the Feaſt <hi>with the old leaven of malice and wickedneſs,</hi> and bidden them <hi>purge out the old leaven,</hi> ver. 7, 8. and <hi>not eat with one called a Brother who ſhould be a Fornicator, an Idolator,</hi> &amp;c. And again <hi>chap.</hi> 10. <hi>ve.</hi> 21. had told them, <hi>They could not drink of the cup of the Lord, and of the cup of Devils, and that they could not be partakers of the Table of the Lord, and of the Table of Devils.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe it ſeems very abſurd to us that a man who ſhould offend but in a point of order ſhould be <hi>guilty of the body and blood of Christ, and eat and drink damnation to himſelf;</hi> which are the two things predicated <hi>of the unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Receiver,</hi> and he who comes reaking with the guilt of ſcandalous ſins ſhould not at all be guilty or lyable to Gods Judgements.</p>
            <pb n="28" facs="tcp:118834:15"/>
            <p>Thirdly becauſe we cannot conceive, that God ſhould be ſo unlike himſelf as to look upon one legally unclean unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to eat the Paſſeover under the old Teſtament, and yet look upon one morally unclean as worthy under the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>We therefore humbly conceive (till <hi>Mr. Timſon</hi> makes the contrary appear to us) that the Subject of thoſe propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.27, 29<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>
               <hi>What Remedy the Apoſtle preſcribes, whether the moſt ignorant perſon, owning the true religion and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate might not uſe it ſo far as to prevent the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and receive benefi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr. Timſon</hi> ſaies the remedy propounded is by <hi>Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> and <hi>Direction.</hi> Inſtruction, to which purpoſe he <hi>remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers them of the Institution.</hi> True, he doth ſo, but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as a mean to convince them of their ſin, or a <hi>Remedy,</hi> I think may be a queſtion.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Then ſaith he, he directs them to <hi>examine</hi> themſelves, and to <hi>tarry for one another.</hi> True but is this all? in caſe there be ſcandalous ſinners in the Church, are the miniſters and officers of the Church to do nothing elſe but bid them <hi>exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine themſelves?</hi> This we are told indeed (<hi>Mr. Boatman</hi> told us ſo too I remember) but I hope in the fifth chap. the Apoſtle had told them of another Remedy; <hi>Not keeping the Feast, not eating with them;</hi> doth it follow that becauſe the Apoſtle doth not repeat it again here, therefore that is no remedy?</p>
            <p>Self-examination is a perſonal Remedy, but there are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Church remedies which the Apoſtle commandeth the uſe
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:118834:15"/>of as well as this. <hi>Mr. Timſon</hi> quaeries whether the remedy be not ſuch (I ſuppoſe ſelf examination is that he means) as the moſt ignorant and the unregenerate may make uſe of, ſo far as to prevent the judgement threatned, and receive benefits thus he openeth himſelf in the ſeventh quaery. So then this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry amounts to this,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whether a man be bound before the Sacrament to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine himſelf any otherwiſe than an unregenerate perſon, and the moſt ignorant perſon profeſſing and owning true Religion may do, about the meer notion of the Sacrament, the insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Queſtion is here concerning the nature of that ſelf-examination, which is the duty of him who would partake worthily at the Lords Table; for when we have determined that, we ſhall eaſily judge whether an unregenerate or ignorant perſon be in a capacity to do it.</p>
            <p>Pag. 21, 22. <hi>Mr. Timſon</hi> is ſtrongly <hi>enclined to believe</hi> that they are onely bound to <hi>examine themſelves concerning the premiſes;</hi> and that Divines ſtretch this precept too far to expound it of any other, becauſe he conceives the Apoſtle ſutes <hi>the remedy to the malady.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr. Humfry</hi> ſubmits his Judgement to other Divines in this thing in his <hi>Rejoinder</hi> p 6. 7. onely ſubjoineth three ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt cautions.</p>
            <p>I cannot ſubſcribe to <hi>Mr. Timſons</hi> inclinations, that the ſelf-examination mentioned 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28. muſt be limitted by the premiſſes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Then it will follow that the Apoſtles mind is a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicant ſhould onely ask himſelf,</p>
            <p>Firſt, Whether <hi>he takes his own Supper before the Lords Supper,</hi> v. 21.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Whether <hi>he knows that what he doth is Chriſts institution,</hi> v. 23, 24, 25.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Whether <hi>he knows the Lords body from common bread</hi> (as <hi>Mr. Humfry</hi> and <hi>Mr. Timſon</hi> expound that phraſe of diſcerning the Lords body) v. 29. ſo let a man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine himſelf and he may come, thinks Mr. <hi>Timſon;</hi> this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is ſhort work. But ſurely,</p>
            <pb n="30" facs="tcp:118834:16"/>
            <p n="2">2. The word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> will not be ſatisfied with ſuch a jejune interpretation; whether it be <hi>verbum forenſe,</hi> as ſome would have it. Surely Magiſtrates examine malefactors more ſtrictly, or <hi>verbum mecchanicum,</hi> as others will have it, The Goldſmiths tryal of his Gold is a more ſearching trial; the Apoſtle expounds it 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Examine your ſelves whether you be in the faith or no, prove your ſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. That another kind of <hi>Examination</hi> is here required, hath been the concurrent Judgement of all Divines, eſpecially thoſe of the reformed Churches, which makes Mr. <hi>Humfry</hi> tender the leading the way to this looſe interpretation, and to ſubmit to their unanimous judgment, I heartily wiſh he had ſhewed himſelf as tender concerning the buſineſs of ſuſpenſion which he might have done upon the ſame principle.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But if they be to examine themſelves no more than whither <hi>they diſcern the Lords body,</hi> we conceive it enough, for it will ly upon Mr. <hi>Humfry</hi> and Mr. <hi>Timſon</hi> to prove that the diſcerning there meant is no more than the diſtingu ſhing betwixt that feaſt and their Love-feaſts; <hi>diſcerning</hi> muſt imply knowledge, I cannot diſcern the Lords body from another thing if I do not know it. I muſt know it as a <hi>body</hi> ſacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally; 2. as the <hi>Lords body:</hi> it will neceſſarily imply a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the <hi>ſign,</hi> and of the <hi>thing ſignified in the Sacrament,</hi> a knowledge of the two natures in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and of what he hath done and ſuffered for me, and of the nature of the Sacrament, and what is held forth in it to the ſoul. And from hence will eaſily follow an anſwer to Mr. <hi>Timſons</hi> 6. query; That <hi>Ignorant perſons</hi> though <hi>(pro formâ)</hi> they do own the Chriſtian Religion, yet are not in a capacity to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine themſelves, ſo as to prevent the Judgement or receive the benefit.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Timſons</hi> 8. query is, <hi>Whether a careleſs neglect, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacity to perform this duty, doth excuſe and give a writ of eaſe from that precept, Do this in remembrance of me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. When Mr. <hi>Timſon</hi> hath proved that <hi>that precept is an univerſal precept that concerns every individual perſon that is baptized and in a capacity to exerciſe reaſon,</hi> we may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly tell him, that his incapacity or careleſs neglect makes
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:118834:16"/>him doubly guilty, and ſo doth not <hi>give a writ of eaſe</hi> but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laies another action upon him. We conceive that precept only to concern the Diſciples of Chriſt, and none but true diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. Though I do not ſee what Mr. <hi>Timſon</hi> can make of it, if we ſay all within the Church are obliged by that precept <hi>in ſenſu compoſito,</hi> that is firſt to examine and then to eat; but not in <hi>ſenſu diviſo.</hi> Nor will it much trouble us which <hi>Mr. Timſon</hi> ſaies p. 23. where he ſaies, The Apoſtles <hi>were bound to call upon thoſe to whom they preached to obſerve all that he had commanded.</hi> Either that Argument will prove, that they were to call upon Pagans, children, &amp;c. to come to the Sacrament, or elſe it ſaies nothing but this, that we are bound to call upon all to obſerve ſuch things as he hath commanded them reſpectively, and then it ſtill remains to prove that Chriſt hath commanded an ignorant profane perſon while ſuch to come to the Sacrament.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Mr. Timſon</hi>'s query p. 24. <hi>Whether any instance can be given, of any under the Law admitted to the other Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances yet debarred the Paſſeover;</hi> we conceive there may. It will poſe <hi>Mr. Timſon</hi> to prove that thoſe who had touched the <hi>dead body of a man</hi> might come at no ordinances but we can prove that they might not come at the Paſſover, <hi>Num.</hi> 9.</p>
            <p>Nor is that whimzy of his p. 25. at all better, by which he would prove the receiving the Sacrament a duty incumbent upon all becauſe included in the firſt table. For beſides that it will poſe Mr. <hi>Timſon</hi> to prove that the ſpecifical duty of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of the Lords Supper is commanded in the firſt Table: If it were, yet I hope preaching the word is ſo alſo, which yet is not a duty enjoined to all, but thoſe only who are appointed thereto.</p>
            <p>Whether it be ſenſe or no I cannot tell, ſure I am it hath no great ſtrength of reaſon that he ſaies ſelf-examination is a private duty, and ſo <hi>ſubordinate to the Publique.</hi> Who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies it? but if he means that we muſt not neglect the publiqu becauſe we cannot perform, or have not performed the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate; Beſides that we queſtion whether upon ſuch an incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city or neglect the publique be a duty, we conceive that where a private duty as commanded in order to prepare us for the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:118834:17"/>publique, we cannot without ſin perform the publique before we have performed the private; cleanſing was the unclean per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons private duty: yet till it was done, we think he might not come to the Paſſeover.</p>
            <p>For his notion p 27. that the <hi>Receiving the Sacrament is the End, and Self-examination the means,</hi> it is ſo far from making for him, that it will conclude that he who cannot or hath not examined himſelf, can no more receive the Sacrament without ſin, neglecting the due means to make him a worthy receiver, then Mr. <hi>Timſon</hi> can prove the wicked ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive without Scripture or reaſon, or write another book without an hand, pen, ink of paper; I had thought due means muſt be neceſſarily ſuppoſed to the end.</p>
            <p>His 9. query is, <hi>Whether there be any thing in the nature, language, actions or end of the Sacrament in</hi> 1 Cor. 11. <hi>or elſewhere, incongruous to the unregenerates receiving.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. there be any thing there or no, I ſhall not diſpute. I have ſaid ſomething to that already, and it is enough if we find it elſewhere, and we conceive there is ſomething contrary to the receiving of the ignorant and ſcandalous, which is the queſtion, for the Church judgeth not of ſecret things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In the <hi>institution</hi> for Chriſt gave it to none ſuch:</p>
            <p n="2">2. In the <hi>nature of it,</hi> for it is <hi>strong meat,</hi> and the ſeal of the righteouſneſs of faith.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In the <hi>language of it</hi> for the ignorant cannot do it in a notional remembrance of Chriſt, nor the ſcandalous in a <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical remembrance of him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. In the <hi>actions</hi> required, for we conceive the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant is ſpiritually as well as corporally to eat and drink, <hi>viz.</hi> to exerciſe faith.</p>
            <p n="5">5 In the end for <hi>we conceive it was instituted, not to convey faith but to ſeal it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But before Mr. <hi>Timſon</hi> can tell us his mind, he muſt lay down ſix <hi>postulata,</hi> and if we will grant them he will do ſomething.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>First he conceives, that this Sacrament is instituted for the good of every particular member of the Church.</hi> We
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:118834:17"/>conceive ſo too; therefore they have <hi>jus ad rem,</hi> but how doth this prove that therefore every particular member ought in his preſent ſtate to come to it, and coming ought to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. 1. <hi>Was not the Paſſover ſo appointed, yet I think the unclean perſons might not come during their uncleanneſs.</hi> 2. I know many reverend men think the excommunicate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is yet a member of the Catholike Church, and I am ſure we ſhall not baptize him again upon his repentance, and he yet poſſibly owns the Chriſtian Religion. So that he is a bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized perſon owning the Chriſtian Religion, and ſo a member of the Church Catholike, and doubtleſs (ſuppoſing his Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance) the Sacrament is inſtituted for his good: but I hope it will not therefore follow he ought in his ſtate of Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to be received to that Communion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For his ſecond, <hi>we will grant it him that the Church confists of good and bad.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. And his third, That the <hi>unregenerate are the proper objects of the promiſe of first grace.</hi> Though that muſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood with a grane of ſalt, and I had rather ſay that the unregenerate are the <hi>only objects of firſt grace;</hi> then the only <hi>objects of the promiſes.</hi> For the promiſes profit not any with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith, and how the unregenerate ſhould exert an act of faith, to apply a promiſe I cannot tell, and I doubt whether it be truth to ſay any promiſes belong to men as unregenerate for if they belong to them as unregerate, they may apply them as unregenerate.</p>
            <p n="4">4. His fourth thing is, <hi>That the whole administration of the Covenant belongs to thoſe in the Church who are the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate objects of the abſolute promiſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>: they being of years of diſcretion to uſe the ſame in order to the Lords putting the promiſes into execution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How [thoſe in the Church] and [being of years of diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on] comes in, I cannot tell, unleſs it be to prevent an anſwer for if Mr. <hi>Timſons</hi> argument be good it is fetch from the right, which an intereſt <hi>in the Covenant promiſes gives one to the Seals of it.</hi> And then it muſt hold univerſally<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and if the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate out of the Church be is much objects of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the firſt grace, as thoſe within there is no reaſon for that reſtriction.</p>
            <pb n="34" facs="tcp:118834:18"/>
            <p>But to ſpeak to his Argument.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To thoſe to whom the abſolute promiſes of the Covenant belong, to thoſe the whole administration, and ſo the ſeals of it belong.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But to the unregenerate in the Church and of years the promiſes belong.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ergo,</p>
            <p>If Mr. <hi>Timſon</hi> will clear this Syllogiſm from the fallacy of 4 terms, the anſwer will be eaſy. Let but belong in each pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pofition be underſtood in the ſame ſenſe, and the argument is weak.</p>
            <p>If by <hi>belonging</hi> he means no more then this, <hi>that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate are thoſe onely</hi> upon whom God ſhines with firſt grace, or to whom God hath declared he will give firſt grace, we deny the <hi>major;</hi> for by this argument heathens may come.</p>
            <p>If by <hi>belonging,</hi> or <hi>being the objects,</hi> he means that thoſe are they only who by faith can apply them and make uſe of them for their ſalvation or conſolation, his <hi>major</hi> is true; but his <hi>minor</hi> is falſe; for no promiſe doth ſo belong to any unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate man, <hi>viz.</hi> as his portion which he may claim and make uſe of in his unregeneracy.</p>
            <p>To his fifth, <hi>That the Sacraments being viſible repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations of the death of Christ on which thoſe promiſes are founded, and by which they are confirmed; The uſe of the Sacrament doth belong to thoſe whom thoſe promiſes do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect.</hi> To this I anſwer;</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the promiſes are founded upon Chriſts death, and confirmed by it, I grant.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>I</hi> grant <hi>alſo the Sacraments are viſible repreſentations of Christs death.</hi> But that is not all, they are ſeals as well as ſigns.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is falſe, <hi>That the uſe of the Sacraments belongs to ſuch as the promiſes of first grace do respect.</hi> For then the uſe of it belongs to heathens; but the uſe of it belongs to thoſe only who by faith apply the promiſes.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>That thoſe in the Church whom we cannot exclude from Covenant relation [being of year] must not be excluded from the Sacrament, becauſe they are ſeals of covenant love to that
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:118834:18"/>people that are i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> poſſeſſion of Covenant administrations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> wonder again how that term [being of years] comes in, for the argument is to prove a right <hi>for covenant Seals</hi> for ſuch as are in <hi>covenant relation,</hi> now children are in covenant, rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. That exception plainly implies that covenant relation is not enough. <hi>I</hi> know if Mr. <hi>Timſon</hi> had thought of it too, he would have excepted <hi>mad men;</hi> for they are in <hi>covenant rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and this argument pleads their right: the upſhot is, <hi>Mr. Timſon</hi> grants here by excepting thoſe not of years, that <hi>cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant relation</hi> is not enough to give <hi>right to covenant ſcals,</hi> ſo he hath anſwered himſelf. For his argument fails if <hi>covenant relation</hi> be not enough, and we ſtill demand what muſt be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peradded? if he ſays <hi>only years,</hi> then mad men have a right, if he <hi>adds a capacity to exerciſe reaſon too.</hi> 1. Let him ſhew us Scripture for theſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> things to be added. 2. I ſpoke to it already.</p>
            <p>He tels us the <hi>elect before converſion are in the writing, and in the Church,</hi> therefore the Sacraments <hi>ſeal to them.</hi> That the elect are enrolled in the everlaſting covenant <hi>I</hi> dare not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; but that they are fully in <hi>covenant is falſe,</hi> Chriſt indeed hath covenanted for them before they believe; but they are not ſaid to be completly in covenant till upon the tender of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant to them in the Goſpel they have accepted the condition. And the Sacrament doth not ſeal to the everlaſting covenant, but to the acceptation of the covenant to which faith muſt be ſuppoſed. For what Mr. <hi>T.</hi> ſaies about baptiſm hath been an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered again and again. He thinks it hard to ſay any in the Church are not in covenant. Concerning the everlaſting cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, <hi>I</hi> know none will ſay it <hi>de individuis;</hi> yet ſurely <hi>Judas</hi> was out though a member of the firſt church, but thoſe who are in a ſtate of unbelief, though they may be objects for Gods firſt free grace, yet ſurely are not in covenant.</p>
            <p>In the 2 or 3 next p. he puts us in hope of 2 or 3 new ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, <hi>I</hi> would fain ſee them, for <hi>I</hi> have not ſeen one brought in this caſe many a day. H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s firſt is from the nature of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; <hi>That it is a viſible Gospel repreſenting Christ crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to all the ſenſes:</hi> what then? <hi>therefore the unregenerate have need of it.</hi> Bravely concluded! he was afraid if he had concluded, <hi>Therefore they have right to it,</hi> we ſhould have
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:118834:19"/>denied the conſequence. The unregenerate have need of Chriſt and all his grace and glory, but have they therefore a right to him? This argument is as old as <hi>Pauls</hi> ſteeple too. But from <hi>need</hi> to <hi>right</hi> is wide concluding. His ſecond is from the end of the Sacrament. <hi>viz. To remember Chriſt;</hi> what then? <hi>The Sacrament is to be obſerved in remembrance of Christ by all thoſe who profeſs hope of being ſaved by his death.</hi> If he had put in lively hope, or will grant me that he means thoſe who <hi>having that hope purify themſelves as God is pure</hi> (w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is the evidence of that hope) I yield it, otherwiſe <hi>I</hi> quaery. But how if they be ignorant of what Chriſt was or did? <hi>How ſhall they do it in remembrance of him?</hi> or how if they by <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane oaths</hi> and <hi>blaſphemies</hi> profane his blood? how ſhall they do it in a practical remembrance of him? Thirdly, he argues learnedly, <hi>They have an hand to take and a mouth to eat.</hi> This argument will prove a Monkies right to it; <hi>I</hi> had thought the taking, eating and drinking muſt be ſpiritual by faith: he asks how we will prove it? if he pleaſeth to compare <hi>Jo.</hi> 6.54, 53, 56. with <hi>v.</hi> 40, 35.50.51, 53. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.17. <hi>Jo.</hi> 3.36. he may find proof for it. 4. The language of the Sacrament runs <hi>in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>for many, for you,</hi> and who were they? Chriſts diſciples.</p>
            <p>It ſounds very harſh he ſaies to ſay the <hi>Sacrament is not a converting Ordinance.</hi> How harſhly it ſounds in Mr. <hi>Timſons</hi> ears <hi>I</hi> cannot tell. Mr. <hi>Gillespy</hi> hath proved it is not by 20 ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, which <hi>M.T.</hi> hath not anſwered, and it will be more hard for <hi>M.T.</hi> to prove, <hi>That Chriſt appointed it for an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary means to convert ſouls.</hi> His argument is worth nothing becauſe it is an <hi>eſſential piece of the Miniſters work,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>it was appointed to ſhew forth Chriſts death.</hi> Let him prove the conſequence of theſe that therefore Chriſt hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed it for converſion; if it were appointed to that end, doubtleſs they exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mmunicate ſhould not be debarred.</p>
            <p n="3">3. His thred bare argumnt p. 40. hath a great hole in it. For though the word and prayer are means of converſion, and they do conſtantly attend the Sacrament, yet it doth not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that the Sacrament <hi>quà</hi> a Sacrament is ſo; nor is there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny need for converſion that the unregenerate ſhould be at it;
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:118834:19"/>for they may hear and pray and not receive. But <hi>M. T.</hi> tels us if bare preſence <hi>anſwer the end, much more would receiving.</hi> We cannot promiſe them their preſence will do them good, but we are ſure their receiving will not, and therefore M. <hi>Ts.</hi> conſequence is nought. In his 3 next pages he falls upon the Doctor who is able to ſpeak for himſelf. In the other part of his book. <hi>I</hi> find nothing <hi>in theſi</hi> to prove the right of the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and ſcandalous, he is altogether dealing with the Doctor and the <hi>Glocesterſhire</hi> miniſters, anſwering what they have ſaid againſt promiſcuous communion. <hi>I</hi> am afraid my Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face will ſwell too much, <hi>I</hi> ſhall therefore turn him over to my elder Brethren.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> think <hi>I</hi> have endeavoured to looſen the Foundation upon which his whole building ſtands; and if <hi>I</hi> miſtake not theſe rotten pillars uphold it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Church memberſhip with a proportion of years, and a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity to exerciſe reaſon gives one full right to the Sacrament.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Any ſuperficial examination, if we know the nature of the inſtitution is all required.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thoſe who are in any covenant relation have right to all covenant ſeals.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Sacrament is a converting Ordinance.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Do this in remembrance of me, is an univerſal precept, which concerns all in the Church, yea and they are bound to do this, though they cannot do what is prerequiſite to it.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Receiving the Sacrament in remembrance</hi> of Chriſt is, nothing but a bodily eating the bread and drinking the wine, and a notional remembrance of the hiſtory of the paſſion of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The Sacrament belongs to all believers, and in Scripture ſenſe there are no unbelievers in the Church, p. 48.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the rotten principles of divinity, which he makes his heads for his arguments, which how contrary they are to Scripture, to reaſon, to the Judgement of all Divines, enquire and judge.</p>
            <p>Being paſt theſe <hi>I</hi> ſhall leave the remaining Structure, <hi>Suis &amp; ipſe viribus liber ruit:</hi> If theſe principles be falſe his book hath not much truth in any one page of it.</p>

            <p>I ſhall now diſmiſs thee from my porch; onely let me give thee a caution or two. Thou wilt find many ſlips either of my pen or the Printer, for which I beg thy pardon: Some I have noted in my firſt part, yet two ſheets of the preface, and two at the end of that eſcaped me; and in the other ſheets ſome alſo ſlipped me after twice reading over, beſides Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma's and Periods, and other ſtops miſplaced, for which I muſt beg thy pardon; poſſibly they might be my faults writing in haſt.</p>
            <p>I hear of ſome intentions in M. <hi>Brabourn</hi> to reply to me. He hath nothing elſe to do. I have. I am aſſured in that he will do nothing to the purpoſe; he is at ten or twelve pound charge to get an anſwer printed; tis pitty, that it ſhould not be worth ſo many farthings when it is done, and that he ſhould not have all the advantage given him can be to help him off with his copies. If with a good conſcience I could, I ſhould be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to anſwer him out of charity to help his book to ſell, but that were the way to make the ſent of his book ſpread it ſelf further. I ſhall therefore promiſe thee nothing but ſilence. If but a rational School-boy ſhall ſend me word that he judgeth me anſwered in any one point, it is ten to one but I may vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate my ſelf, otherwaies I ſhall think him more an object of pitty than any revenge; for this age tels us there are ſome who both want wit to write, and diſcretion to hold their peace.</p>

This is the great <hi>bone of contention</hi> in the Church of God this day, every one would be <hi>fellow commoner</hi> with the Saints at the Table of <hi>childrens bread,</hi> and thoſe who have not <hi>grace</hi> to make them worthy, yet want pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to beare a being judged unworthy of the higheſt Goſpell-priviledges. Reader, I ſuppoſe thou canſt not be ſo unjuſt to thy owne reaſon, but to thinke that if the godly Miniſters of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> durſt <hi>conſult with fleſh and bloud,</hi> that could furniſh them with ſtrong Arguments, drawne from the <hi>augmentation of their livelihood</hi> (in pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where it is arbitrary) and from the <hi>univerſall love of their people</hi> to compell them into Maſter <hi>Humfryes</hi> or Maſter <hi>Boatmans</hi> faith. Alas! what doe we get by our ſtricter dealings, with the ſoules committed to us, except the <hi>frownes and reproaches</hi> of ſuch whom we durſt not caſt <hi>the holy thing</hi> of the Sacrament before. It is Gods will that <hi>Religion and humane Policy</hi> ſhould now and then divide, and we humbly ſubmit to God, and deſire rather to be faithfull <hi>Stewards</hi> for him, then <hi>providers</hi> for our ſelves, and ours. Surely there is ſo much <hi>ingenuity</hi> at leaſt in ſome of the godly Miniſters of <hi>England,</hi> as would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title them to a <hi>deſire of the love of all,</hi> and ſo much <hi>earthineſſe</hi> in all their hearts as expoſeth them to ſome <hi>temptations,</hi> to uſe all endeavours for a

If any of them neglects both that and this, and chuſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to venture the begging of their own bread, then to throw the <hi>childrens bread to dogs,</hi> rather to <hi>proſtitute their owne names,</hi> and loſe their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in the hearts of <hi>ſome people,</hi> then to <hi>proſtitute</hi> the Lords ſacred Ordinance, and <hi>give his name to a reproach,</hi> as in this they come ſhort of <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome,</hi> who profeſſeth, he would rather give his owne bloud to the prophane, then the body and bloud of Chriſt; and of <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> who ventured the loſſe of his head as well as the love of <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſius:</hi> ſo it will not need much of thy charity, to interpret their actions, <hi>conſcientious pieces of ſelf-deniall,</hi> for the <hi>intereſt of their deare and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour,</hi> yea and of their ſoules too who are kept away, it being certaine, if <hi>Iudas</hi> were at the Sacrament (which can never be proved) the next worke he did was to hang himſelfe, through hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of conſcience, and for that ſinne of unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy receiving in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> Many, ſaith the Apoſtle, were ſick and weak, and many fallen aſleep. How unjuſtly therefore we are raged againſt, who durſt not give the bloud of Chriſt to thoſe to drinke who are in a burning feaver of open luſts, and ſo dangerous a knife into the hands of thoſe whom we ſee diſtracted with ſinne, and in a ſpirituall <hi>Delirium.</hi> We hope, any equitable ſtanders by will judge and meaſure our actions, by the duly and orderly practiſe of Phyſitians in bodily tempers, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering

            <p>As to the ſubject of this Tract, the truth is, ſo much hath been ſaid in the defence of what I plead for, of old, by all the Schoolmen, and ſince by <hi>Calvin, Vrſin, Zanchy,</hi> and by Reverend <hi>Beza,</hi> and Maſter <hi>Rutherford</hi> in anſwer to <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> and by learned and Reverend <hi>Gilleſpy</hi> in anſwer to Maſter <hi>Prynne,</hi> beſides what hath been ſpoken by Maſter <hi>Philip Goodwin</hi> in his excellent Book, called <hi>the Evangelicall Communicant,</hi> and by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others; that were it not for the importunate <hi>clamours</hi> of thoſe who would get that by their <hi>importunity,</hi> and <hi>clamorous tongues and pens,</hi> which the <hi>juſtice of their Cauſe,</hi> and <hi>ſtrength of their Arguments,</hi> will not allow to them, nor gaine for them, both my ſelfe and others might have had an eternall <hi>ſuperſedeas</hi> for this Worke. I ſcarce find any thing in <hi>Erastus</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi> but what I meet with in the Schoolmen, nor any thing in Maſter <hi>Prynne,</hi> or Maſter <hi>Humfry</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, but what I find in <hi>Erastus:</hi> That if our Brethren of the contrary perſwaſion, would not have troubled the world with their opinions, without anſwering firſt what had been ſaid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them: we had long ere this time had our <hi>Quietus eſt;</hi> for I durſt undertake to yeeld him the cauſe, who ſufficiently anſwers but one Book wrote upon this ſubject, <hi>viz.</hi> Maſter <hi>Gilleſpies Aarons Rod bloſſoming;</hi> ſo that the truth is, the advantage our oppoſites have of us in this point, is moſtly upon ſuch as <hi>have not knowledge</hi> of what hath been ſaid againſt their opinions, or

            <p>I have often thought that it would be a rare expedient in order to the ending of all contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies of theſe times, relating to the order of the Church; if ſome judicious man would out of all the conſiderable Books wrote upon each Controverſie, within theſe twelve or thirteen yeares, candidly ſtate each Controverſie, and tranſcribe the Arguments relating to them, with the Exceptions and Anſwers given to any, digeſting them in a due method, and it might pleaſe the civill power then to Enact, <hi>That no one ſhould write more upon any of thoſe Queſtions,</hi> but <hi>ſhould be engaged either to bring New Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on the part he would defend, or vindicate thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:118834:26"/>brought on the part he would defend from the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Anſwers given to them.</hi> Were this taske but impoſed upon new Scriblers, the world would be leſſe full of impertinent Diſcourſes, and Diſputes would not run as they doe <hi>in infinitum.</hi> I doe not pretend a <hi>ſpecimen</hi> of ſuch a Worke, I have neither purſe nor Library, nor time, fit for it. But the truth is, as I find in Mr <hi>Humfry,</hi> and heare from Mr <hi>Boatman,</hi> nothing more then <hi>Eraſtus</hi> long ſince ſaid, and hath been more then once already anſwered; ſo I have not ſtudied for a new Argument, but out of ſeverall Authors have rallyed up an old force, and have candidly told thee what hath been by any, whom I have met with, ſaid againſt them, as alſo what hath been anſwered in their defence: <hi>All being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Paſſover</hi> (as ſome conceive) <hi>Iohn Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts univerſall Baptiſme; Iudas his being admitted to the Lords Supper; The generall invitation to the Wedding Supper in the Goſpell; ſome being drunke at the Lords Supper in the Church of Corinth.

               </gap>. Theſe are all old tooles, and ſcarce newly whetted.</p>
            <p>Yet what hath Maſter <hi>Humfry</hi> ſaid, or what doth Maſter <hi>Boatman</hi> ſay more? But for the more particular occaſion of this Tract,</p>
            <p>I muſt deſire of thee (Reader) to underſtand, that in this great City there are, as I take it, about thirty Pariſhes within the Wals, to none of which (excepting only two, one of which hath
<pb facs="tcp:118834:26"/>about thirty pounds <hi>per annum</hi>) is above ten or twelve pounds a yeare certaine legall mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; The moſt of the Pariſhes have nothing at all. Scandalous Livings are alwayes the neſts of ſcandalous Miniſters; The Pariſhes being little, and the maintenance Arbitrary, and many of the people ſeaſoned with the old leaven of ignorance and ſuperſtition, many, if not moſt of our Pariſhes have been either without any Miniſter, or filled with ſuch who were caſt out of other places, or at leaſt no friends to Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>For thoſe Pariſhes in which were a more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable number of godly and well diſpoſed people, ſome of them were better ſupplyed; but in all the City we were able to doe very little to promote the worke of Reformation: Some of the Congregations either wanting godly Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, or perſons fit to be choſen, as <hi>Helpers with them in Government,</hi> and the people in others wanting an heart to chuſe; yet through much oppoſition, in two or three Pariſhes we procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red an Election of Elders, amongſt which <hi>Peters</hi> was one, being the moſt conſiderable place in the City, and furniſhed both with perſons fit to be choſen, and a people willing to chuſe, and a <hi>Reverend Paſtor,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mr <hi>Carter.</hi>
               </note> fit to goe in and out before them.</p>
            <p>But the yoake of Jeſus Chriſt (which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes eaſie to a gracious heart) doth always gall the necks of thoſe who have made their luſts
<pb facs="tcp:118834:27"/>Lords, ſome of the people who had the taſte <hi>of the fleſh pots of Aegypt</hi> yet in their mouth, began to kick at this ſuppoſed burthen; ſome withdrew their ſtipends, in ſhort, ſome one way, others another way, tyred out their <hi>Reverend and Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Paſtor,</hi> who after ſeverall thoughts of remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall from them, about <hi>May</hi> laſt reſolved upon it.</p>
            <p>About that time, one Maſter <hi>Boatman</hi> (ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of <hi>Hull</hi>) was commended to them; we who were Miniſters of the Goſpell in the City, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it our duty, as we had opportunities, to enquire of him (to whom ere long it would be expected that we ſhould give the right hand of fellowſhip.) Amongſt others, my ſelfe, as I had occaſion offered, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, made ſome Enquiry concerning him, ſoone after ſpeaking with a <hi>Miniſter,</hi> who <hi>ſometimes lived in Yorkſhire,</hi> I askt him if he knew ſuch a Miniſter in their Countrey, and what he was. He told me he knew him very well, <hi>and he was a man who would preach frequently, and was a great enemy to Sectaries, but himſelfe was neither Miniſter nor Graduate.</hi> Soon after, a <hi>Reverend and Godly Miniſter of Lincolne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> comming to ſee me, I asked him the ſame Queſtions, who confirmed the ſame things. Concerning the thing eſtabliſhed out of the mouths of two witneſſes, I imparted it to two friends, one a Miniſter, the other a judicious Chriſtian inhabiting in the Pariſh: And this I did the rather, becauſe I heard they were about
<pb facs="tcp:118834:27"/>to invite him for a Probationer, and I my ſelfe (having a Moneth to ſpend in the Univerſity) was to be abſent, that ſo if he came, theſe things might be enquired after. While I was in the Univerſity, I (occaſionally at dinner at the Vice-chancellors chamber, &amp; being at ſupper the ſame nightwith one of the Proctors) met with two Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, one at each place, both of <hi>Lincolne-ſhire,</hi> where I knew Maſter <hi>Boatman</hi> had his reſidence, they both confirmed the ſame things, adding ſomething more (which I ſhall ſpare, except Maſter <hi>Boatman</hi> provokes me to ſpeake it) being deſirous rather to vindicate my ſelfe then to aſperſe him. While I was abſent, ſome of his friends had ſufficiently branded me for ſaying he was no <hi>Graduate,</hi> when as he was a Reverend man, a Batchelour of Divinity (forſooth) of <hi>Katherine Hall:</hi> One of them fell upon me face to face at my returne, I told them I would not be over-confident, becauſe it was but a Report, but I would ſoone ſatisfie them as to that point. Thereupon I wrote a Letter by the next Poſt, to a Learned friend, Fellow of that Houſe, who certified me, <hi>That he knew him very well, That by admiſsion he was two yeares my junior, That for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, he was three degrees beneath a Batchelour in Divinity, having never commenced at all, nor ſtaid in the Colledge above a yeare, or a yeare and halfe at utmoſt.</hi> Some other things he certified me, which I ſhall conceale, intending only my owne vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:118834:28"/>
            <p>This was the only Letter I ever wrote to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of him, (and that in my owne vindication too) though I heare he hath told his friends, he hath Copies of ſeverall Letters I wrote to that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Soone after this, a Reverend Brother in this City had another Letter from a godly and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Miniſter, who was of his year and Colledge, to omit other paſſages in the Letter, he told him that he never <hi>commenced any thing but junior So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By all this we gathered, That an — <hi>Harry So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſter</hi> was the height of his Univerſity-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencements. It was now about <hi>Iuly,</hi> when the Anabaptiſticall party began to rage againſt <hi>Vniverſity-Learning,</hi> and <hi>Degrees.</hi> We who were Miniſters in this City, were a little ſenſible, (if we had been ſatisfied concerning him upon other accounts) what an ill ſound it would make in the world, to be heard, that the greateſt Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in ſo famous a City as this, and a Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation which ever had either a Doctor in Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, or ſome very reverend man in it, ſhould now be ſupplyed with one, who had given no proofe in any Univerſitie of his abilities, or profici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie in his Studies, nor ſo much as taken the loweſt degree in the Schooles.</p>
            <p>This made ſome of us, doe what in us lay, to move thoſe who were our ſober, pious friends in that Congregation, to act deliberately in ſo weighty a worke; in which the glory of God;
<pb facs="tcp:118834:28"/>the good of the City, the intereſt of their ſoules, and their credit and reputation would be ſo much concerned; and that before they agreed to his Election, they would enquire concerning his later converſation, and be ſatisfied that he were a Miniſter in Office at leaſt. We thought, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that juncture of time, and the eminency of the place, it would alſo be fit, that at leaſt he ſhould be Mr of Arts.</p>
            <p>At laſt he came to the Towne, and a party of the people elected him as their Paſtor (one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and eleven having before ſubſcribed Maſter <hi>Carter</hi> a new Call, promiſing to wait a yeare for him.) Diverſe godly people diſſented from the Election openly, and the rather, becauſe he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to ſatisfie them concerning his Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I ſhall referre to my Reader to enquire other paſſages concerning his Election. About three weeks after <hi>Michaelmas</hi> he came to reſide, but before this he had declared himſelfe for <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> ſomthing plainly; (we ſuppoſe he was of another judgement when he preached at <hi>Hull.</hi>) He had alſo by this time declared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to a <hi>Reverend</hi> Miniſter in the City for <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuous communions,</hi> and within a day or two af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter told a godly man, <hi>pinching him upon that point, that he ſhould well ſee he was not for promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous communions;</hi> ſoon after his comming to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, we had heard he had declared himſelfe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately againſt Ruling Elders;</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:118834:29"/>
            <q>
               <hi>Presbyter, haud ame te, nec poſſum dicere quare, Hoc tantùm poſſum dicere, non amo te.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>For his judgement in that point, or indeed in any other, it is not much conſiderable; for we doe not thinke he is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and we can eaſily beleeve that we have more to ſay, yea that more hath already been ſaid to prove the divine Right of that <hi>O ficer</hi> in the Church, then Mr <hi>Boatman</hi> can anſwer.</p>
            <p>About the beginning of <hi>December</hi> after, about ſix weeks reſidence amongſt a people, he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſeen before (except as a gueſt for a forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night) nay, and as I remember of that ſix weeks he was abſent for a fortnight too; He declares he intended to adminiſter a Sacrament on <hi>Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> day, ſome honeſt people of his Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being diſsatisfied at it, went to him, and told him ſo, in regard of the ſuperſtitious conceit of that day, which many in this City have. One of his friends told me, they had prevailed with him ſo far, as that the next day he would unbid it againe, but in ſtead of it, the next Lords day, in ſtead of unbidding it (girding at thoſe who had received this offence) he openly proclaimes foure Sacraments together. The firſt upon the eighteenth day of <hi>December;</hi> the ſecond upon the five and twentieth, &amp;c. and proclaimed like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a Faſt Preparatory to them upon the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of <hi>December:</hi> At which Faſt (Reader)
<pb facs="tcp:118834:29"/>thou muſt thinke there was much people to ſee which way he would row, (though they needed not, if they had conſidered the wind and tyde) For my ſelfe, I was not there, having with ſome other of my Brethren refuſed to heare him, who refuſeth to let us know by what Authority he preaches, and conceiving that the Paſtorall Right to that people belongs not to him, (beſides other things which diſcover him to us to be no friend to any kind of Reformation. At his Faſt he preached on <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.12. His diſcourſe in the forenoone was harmleſſe, in the afternoon he diſgorged himſelfe.</p>
            <p>I ſhall give thee a ſhort account of that part of his Sermon which concernes this buſineſſe, as it was taken (and given me by an ingenuous judicious Schollar) from his owne mouth in ſhort hand; and by one who was (before that Sermon) much his friend.</p>

The ſinne of Paſtor and people in the enjoyment of that great Ordinance, is the cauſe and ground that God hath found out away, and by away of his owne find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, which a man would have thought at firſt ſhould never have prevailed, which hath hindred the people of the enjoyment of that great Ordinance of the communion of the body and bloud of Christ.

               </gap>, from houſe to houſe. I am ſure he did neither of theſe, and 'tis no wonder he did not know them then. But he walks by another rule, for he profeſſeth here, That except the profane be firſt admoniſhed, then <hi>excommunicated</hi> (which he knowes now they cannot be, except by Elderſhips, which his judgement is not for belike) no power on the earth hath the leaſt <hi>ſeeming</hi> or <hi>ſemblable</hi> Authority to keep any from the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yea, and this is his Say (notwithſtanding all the <hi>Learning of all the Miniſters on earth:</hi> yea and he tels us ſo againe, <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Nay more, he deſires, nay he challengeth (with as much humility as we can thinke he hath, after he hath ſo boldly charged all the Churches of God, as <hi>Drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, Phariſaicall Dreamers,</hi> &amp;c.) any to ſhew him the leaſt footſteps for it from the Word of God.

Look to your ſelves, beleeve every man his Brother better than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, this is Evangelicall counſell. Some will ſay, I ſee ſuch, and ſuch profane, adviſe them; haſt thou done that? If not, thou haſt ſinned againſt the Goſpell, and his ſin is not ſo much his as thine; doſt thou cry out of him, and haſt not prayed for him? particularly admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed him? and ſoberly? that for the time to come he would take a better courſe; haſt thou done it with mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, meekneſſe, ſobriety, tenderneſſe, and ſeaſonably reſtored thy brother overtaken? Raile not, revile him
<pb facs="tcp:118834:37"/>not, cry not out againſt him; make not his private ſin publike, let not every one take notice of it of which thou takeſt notice, do not ſin againſt thy Brothers ſoule. — But ſome are not yet ſatisfied if the profane be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and the Sacrament be adminiſtred promiſcuouſly the Ordinance will be defiled. A pretty dreame! Is not the Word as ſoone defiled becauſe a profane man heares it? As ſoone that may as the Sacrament; what is another mans receiving unto thee if thou receiveſt worthily? I do not remember the Scripture tells us, that any man got any hurt by the man that came without the wedding gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; nor did any man ever the more ſhun the roome or caſt him out, only indeed the Maſter came, and he turned him out. Let the profane take heed left they be turned out, Chriſt may find them out.</hi> For this cauſe many are ſick, and weake, <hi>&amp;c. and he may caſt them into utter darkneſſe.</hi> But although Chriſt hath this authority, I know no Miniſter hath any ſuch. <hi>What have we to do if it be thus? Only theſe two things: and I deſire you, eſpecially of this Congregation, to joine with me in an humble and ſerious confeſſion to God of our former pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes.</hi> 2. <hi>As heartily to renew ſolemnly your Covenant made in Baptiſme againſt the fleſh, the world, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, you know how guilty you have been all of the breach of it. That once done,</hi> I will take upon me on good grounds to call you holy to the Lord, <hi>and ſeriouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite you to this worke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this laſt Paragraph, the greateſt part of it is ſomething better than ordinary; men of this Gang could not ſo ſecurely raile againſt examination by El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſhips, and enquiries after the flock, if they did not pretend for a great deale of zeale for private examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. There were ſome of old, <hi>that to devoure wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows</hi> houſes the better <hi>made long prayers.</hi> I wiſh that all the pretended ſtrictneſſe of ſome, for ſelfe-exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, be not only a vizard to mock the world with,
<pb facs="tcp:118834:37"/>while they rob the Church of the divine Ordinances of <hi>Presbyteries,</hi> and <hi>Suſpenſion,</hi> &amp;c. But yet in this Paragraph</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>he ownes all that he hath ſaid before,</hi> and tels his people, <hi>It is the truth, and nothing but the truth of God;</hi> apply this to all he had ſaid before: <hi>That Suſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was a dreame, a meere dreame, a phariſaic all inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for which was not the leaſt footſtep in Gods word; that no power under heaven hath any ſeeming, or ſemblable authority to keepe any from the Sacrament that will preſs to it on their own ſcore.</hi> That thoſe who do it are <hi>proud, uncharitable, intruders upon Chriſts Office, that former Ages never thought of it;</hi> all this is the truth, he ſaith, and <hi>nothing but the truth of God:</hi> yea, and he ſaith it againe, <hi>That it is not in the power of any particular Miniſter or Congregation,</hi> without cleare conviction and <hi>condemnation,</hi> to keep any away; what he meanes by Conviction and Condemnation he told us before three or foure times over they muſt be <hi>Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether a <hi>ſingle Miniſter</hi> hath power or no is a queſtion ſome make, but Mr <hi>Boatman</hi> hath no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon (for he owneth no Elderſhip) and the Rubrick allowed it to a ſingle Miniſter in ſome caſes: but he had expounded himſelfe before: <hi>No power on earth can do it.</hi> And in the very next words here, <hi>If he will ruſh, no man hath any thing to do with him.</hi> And now he tels his people, <hi>If they will ruſh they may, their bloud he upon their ſoules, he hath quitted his hands,</hi> &amp;c. Thus <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.24. <hi>Pilate</hi> when he had condemned Chriſt, <hi>tooke water and waſhed his hands, ſaying, I am innocent of the bloud of this juſt perſon, ſee ye to it.</hi> It is a good wiſh he wiſheth, that <hi>the ſcoffe might become a reall truth that all were Saints at</hi> Peters. The ſcoffe he referreth to we know not, unleſſe it were one raiſed by one of his own friends, who having got
<pb facs="tcp:118834:38"/>their Paſtor amongſt them to a cup of Sack and a pipe of Tobacco, merrily told an honeſt man, that ſuch a night <hi>their Paſtor and ſome of</hi> Peters <hi>Chriſtians were at ſuch a place conferring together;</hi> whence ſome called thoſe who <hi>frequent ſuch meetings</hi> Peters <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> But the wiſh was good.</p>
            <p>His next counſell is good, only he ſhould have told his people, that if the offence be notorious and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like that private admonition ſhall not need precede; <hi>Him that ſinneth openly rebuke openly</hi> (ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle.)</p>
            <p>He feares ſome will thinke the Ordinance is defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>if the profane be admitted;</hi> this he calls a <hi>pretty dreame,</hi> and ſaies <hi>the Word is as much d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>filed, &amp;c.</hi> To this I ſhall ſpeake hereafter, with Mr <hi>Boatmans</hi> leave, though the Ordinance be not capable of any intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecall pollution, yet the <hi>Communion is defiled</hi> by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during profane perſons in it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.6. (if the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle knew what he ſaid) yea, and the people that communicate are defiled if they do not their duty, admoniſhing them, informing the Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be ſure the Officers of the Church are defiled, for it was their duty to have hept them away.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But Mr</hi> Boatman <hi>doth not remember any man got hurt by the preſence of him that wanted the wedding garment, nor ſhunned the roome for him, only the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter came and turned him out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Before this will prove any thing to the purpoſe, <hi>he muſt prove that the Supper, there mentioned, was the Lords Supper,</hi> otherwiſe this is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, he muſt prove, that that Gueſt <hi>did not only want the wedding garment,</hi> but <hi>that he wore an open filthy garment;</hi> an hypocrite wants the wedding Garment, yet I know none ſay, the preſence of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites defiles a Communion; why? becauſe man cannot judge the heart; but the queſtion is whether the
<pb facs="tcp:118834:38"/>preſence of groſs ſinners defiles the Communion or no?</p>
            <p n="3">3. None ſaies, <hi>the bare preſence of aſcandalous ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> defiles the particular ſoule of a private member, but it defiles the Officers, and the Communion.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Mr <hi>Boatman</hi> doth remember the Maſter turn'd him out. So it is Chriſts will, belike, none ſhould be there but ſuch as have the wedding garment; and the queſtion is, whether he (now he is aſcended) hath left us ſufficient power to do his will as to ſuch wanters of the wedding garment as our eyes can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Holy Mr. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> thinks that Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Ambroſe <hi>his Media. p.</hi> 260.</note> turning out him who wanted the wedding-garment, is a good Argument for to evince our duty to turne away ſuch as appeare to us to want it, (we being, in Chriſts ſtead, his Embaſſadours, Stewards, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) But Mr <hi>Boat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> tels us againe <hi>we have no ſuch authority;</hi> we will anon joyne iſſue with him in that point. In the laſt place, he exhorts his people to confeſſion, and renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Covenant, and then he pronounceth his people all <hi>Holy to the Lord.</hi> I hope he meant in the largeſt ſenſe of holineſſe.</p>
            <p>This Reader is a perfect account of that whole part of his Sermon which gave occaſion to this enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tract. I confeſſe, for my own part, I heard it not, no more did ſcarce any of our Miniſters, ſome of us being reſolved firſt to be ſatisfied, <hi>That he hath autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to preach</hi> (which we have very good grounds to ſuſpect he hath not;) but theſe notes were given me, upon my deſire by an ingenious young man, who is a Schollar, who tooke them in ſhort hand from Mr <hi>Boatman's</hi> mouth, and gives me leave, <hi>Reader,</hi> to tell thee that he will juſtifie, that they are a true account of that part of his Sermon, to Mr <hi>Boatman,</hi> or any other. I ſaw the ſeverall other Notes, taken by others,
<pb facs="tcp:118834:39"/>though more imperfectly, becauſe taken in long-hand, which yet have the ſame paſſages concerning Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion, and thoſe who practice it. If they be deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, thou ſhalt have them in the next atteſted by ſix or ſeven more.</p>
            <p>In the meane time I appeale to ſuch Chriſtians in this City, as heard that Sermon, whether thoſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, concerning <hi>Suſpenſion,</hi> and thoſe who practice it, be not faithfully recorded.</p>
            <p>My ſelfe was that day employed in a meeting with other Miniſters of the City; I was no ſooner returned home at night to my Study, but there came to me foure or five honeſt men, exceedingly troubled at the Sermon, one of them almoſt in a rage, profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing he never heard ſo much <hi>audaciouſneſſe</hi> in a Pulpit; they were (indeed) all very much troubled, and read me their Notes. The next day was my Lecture day, in which I was to preach a preparation Sermon to the Sacrament; perceiving that we had been ſo bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly challenged, and ſo rudely reflected upon, I thought it my duty to take notice of it, and in my Sermon <hi>in theſi</hi> ſpake to it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Proving that Suſpenſion of the ignorant and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous from the Lords Table (though they were not Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated was juſtifiable from Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Proving that it was ſo far from <hi>being a phariſaicall dreame,</hi> that it had <hi>been the judgement and practice of the Servants and Churches of God in all ages, and of our owne ever ſince the firſt dawnings of Reformation amongſt us in the daies of King</hi> Henry 8.</p>
            <p>This was carried to him, and I heare that on the Lords day (which was his firſt Sacrament day) he was taken up with admiring the bold face of them who ſhould ſay any ſuch thing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that he quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Diſcipline of the <hi>French Church</hi> as a witneſſe againſt Suſpenſion, (how truly we will examine
<pb facs="tcp:118834:39"/>anon.) By this time the ſpirits of his friends were up, and a great cry there was about the Towne, that we could talke, but durſt not diſpute, with this new Champion, he had challenged us all, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular this was laid to my charge. I confeſſe I had ſo much pride as to thinke him an adverſary ſomething below me; but yet to ſtop his friends mouths, and eſpecially to vindicate the truth, and Ordinances of God, and our own practice from him, by the advice of two or three Reverend Miniſters, upon the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth of <hi>December,</hi> I drew up this enſuing Letter in the preſence of two Reverend Miniſters, and read it to them, and they approving it, upon the 21. I ſent it to him by the hands of two honeſt men, his Pariſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners. The Letter follows <hi>Verbatim.</hi>

                  <pb facs="tcp:118834:40"/>
                  <p>Sir, I know not wherefore God hath ſet me in this City but to ſtand up for his glory, and for the defence of his truth and Ordinances; and though I have not been <hi>a man of war from my youth,</hi> yet I muſt not now ſtand ſtill and heare you defie the Churches, and Servants, and Miniſters of the living God as Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſaicall dreamers, and this day after day. Theſe are therefore to let you know, that I accept your chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge, and (in oppoſition to what you ſaid) ſhall be ready when, and where you pleaſe (ſo it be before a competent number of witneſſes) to maintaine againſt you,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That the ſuſpenſion of ſome perſons from the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, beſides Turkes, Jews, and Heathens, and thoſe who are caſt out of the Church by Excommunication is grounded on the Scripture, and deducible from it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>That it is ſo far from being a phariſaicall dreame, that it hath been the conſtant judgement of the Servants of God in all times of other reformed Churches, and our own ever ſince the beginning of reformation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Either of theſe (Sir) I ſhall maintaine againſt you, either in a more <hi>publike</hi> or <hi>private</hi> diſpute. More pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately, (if you thinke fit) before as many Miniſters as will come &amp; twelve private Chriſtians, choſen by each or more, (provided the number choſen be equall on both ſides.) Or more publikely, in the Church, and in what Church you pleaſe; (ſuch Laws being firſt agreed on as are fit to regulate ſuch a diſpute.) If you accept either of theſe, let me know the time and place, (provided it be not on my Lecture day) and I ſhall be ready to appeare in this cauſe of God againſt you. And to this I expect a ſudden anſwer, otherwiſe I ſhall thinke my ſelfe bound to let the world know, that as your Charge favoured of too much Phariſaicall pride, to condemne ſo many as <hi>Phariſees,</hi> dreaming Phariſees too.

            <p>—<hi>teneat cornicula riſum?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Reader! I hope thou wilt judge this Letter did not deſerve an anſwer, and if I durſt not have truſted thee with my credit againſt this adverſary, thou ſhouldſt not have ſeen it, but I perceive it miſ-repreſented in the world, and cried up as the meekeſt, humbleſt Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now read, and I ſhall make thee (who ever thou art) my Judge, only take a few notes to help thee better to underſtand it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I did a little wonder at the Superſcription that he ſhould own me under the Notion of a <hi>Batchelour in Divinity.</hi> I confeſſe, I have performed the exerciſes
<pb facs="tcp:118834:41"/>required of him who takes that degree in our Schooles, and the Univerſity hath pleaſed to give me their Seale, to let others know that they have been pleaſed to conferre that degree upon me; but for Mr <hi>Boatman,</hi> ſure <hi>indignus eſt qui dicat,</hi> of all men he ſhould have taken no notice of it, having ſo liberally in the morning called me <hi>Trifle, ſimple fellow,</hi> &amp;c. eſpecially conſidering that himſelfe is not yet Batche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of Arts.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In the beginning of this Letter he tels me of <hi>unchriſtian incivilities</hi> I have offered him. I never yet came in his company, how I ſhould uſe him ſo uncivil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I know not. My nature doth diſpoſe me to as much civility I hope as anothers, and I would be loath to be uncivill to mine enemy, much leſſe to a ſtranger. I profeſſe, <hi>Reader,</hi> thou haſt heard all I have been ever guilty of, and I referre it to thee to conſider, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were uncivill for a Miniſter of the Goſpell in a City, hearing of one called to a place of eminency in the City, as he had occaſion to enquire of him, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially being one who lived at three or foureſcore miles diſtance, and was not known in theſe parts, and to informe the people faithfully what he heard. If I, hearing the man was no graduate, no Miniſter, nay, far more which I ſhall conceale, (though as to other things I ſhall not deſire to aſperſe him) did perſwade my friends amongſt the people to be deliberate in their choice and firſt to enquire. I hope this was ſo far from incivility, that it was my duty. I appeale to all the world to charge me with any other incivillities than theſe which I apprehend my duty.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thou ſeeſt, Reader, he <hi>denies the charge,</hi> how juſtly judge by the Notes of the Sermon before; ſurely he hath a great meaſure of confidence to deny what he ſo often inculcated, but he adds, he denies it <hi>[in thoſe termes]</hi> what termes he meanes I cannot
<pb facs="tcp:118834:42"/>tell. Logicall termes are proper to a <hi>queſtion,</hi> and ſo the termes are two. <hi>The Subject,</hi> Suſpenſion. <hi>The Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate, that it is a dreame of the Phariſees.</hi> I thinke thou wilt find theſe the termes in his Sermon. But perhaps he meanes Grammaticall termes, <hi>Letters,</hi> and <hi>Syllables,</hi> and <hi>words,</hi> if he did, it is a pitifull ſhift.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But it had been enough to me for him to have eaten his words, but that he licks them up againe, and ſaies, <hi>What he ſaid he will juſtifie, and I ſhall ſee it was neither</hi> lapſus linguae, <hi>nor an errour of the mind.</hi> So the buſineſſe is to prove he ſaid ſo only, for he will avouch what he ſaid; that he ſaid ſo, I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved already, and if it be openly denied, I will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to prove it by more than three or foure witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; and I appeale to thoſe who heard him that day for witneſſes.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Diſputing he doth not love; no, he tels us, <hi>he will not take a great deale of paines for trifles.</hi> Thus, Reader thou ſeeſt it is eaſier to make a challenge than to defend it: Who I wonder would have challenged him? I know no Miniſters in this City but would have looked upon him as an improper match for them, had he not openly challenged us, and loudly enough charged both us, and the Churches, and Servants of God, as <hi>Dreamers, phariſaicall Dreamers, bold intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders upon Chriſts authority, ſuch as do things contrary to all former ages, who deviſe things to implode Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> &amp;c. Thus he talkes, we turne againe to give him battle he runs away, and tells us, he will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow paines to ſo little purpoſe; valiantly done! Is it not thinke you?</p>
            <p n="6">6. But he tels me, <hi>if I appeare in publike,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>he ſhall then know what he hath to do.</hi> In obedience to him, and conceiving him at ſome little loſſe as to that point, I have wrote; what he will do now I do not know nor care.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:118834:42"/>
            <p n="7">7. He charges me ſufficiently thou ſeeſt, as 1. <hi>A Companion of Backebiters.</hi> 2. One <hi>who hath given him foule language.</hi> So foule that it puts the good man to his prayers. 3. <hi>One of a ſtrange ſpirit.</hi> 4. <hi>One who loves to appeare in publike.</hi> 5. <hi>One who have groſſely deported my ſelfe to a Gentleman,</hi> &amp;c. 6. <hi>A wrangler.</hi> 7. <hi>A lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of contention.</hi>

I deſire to be a Companion of thoſe who feare the Lord; who are his Companions let others obſerve and judge, I ſhall not judge any.</p>
            <p>I thinke the rule good, — <hi>Noſcitur ex ſocio qui non dignoſcitur ex ſe,</hi> that a man who is not known of himſelfe is known by his Companion, which laies a little obligation upon me, beſides what Gods Word laies.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>For my love to appeare in Print,</hi> I can ſay ſomthing to vindicate my ſelfe. I have Printed nothing but three or foure practicall diſcourſes, at whoſe ſollicitations, and after how many ſollicitations, ſome very neare me can tell; and I have ſome Letters from very Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend mento teſtifie. And two or three polemicall diſcourſes the glory of God required them of me in theſe ſinfull times. I know not what ſhould make me ſo love that work: <hi>not honour ſure.</hi> It is almoſt a ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall in this Age to be ſeen under the Preſſe, ſo ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully is it proſtituted. <hi>Not Gaine.</hi> I never yet ſold a Copy to my Stationer; nay, beſides fifty or ſixty Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies,
<pb facs="tcp:118834:43"/>given me for my friends, I have been forced to buy uſually as many more. <hi>Surely it is no pleaſure.</hi> Thoſe who know what it is, firſt to ſtudy, then to tranſcribe a tract, then to review the ſheets, and to make Tables, find it no pleaſant worke. <hi>It was not to employ my ſelfe.</hi> Thoſe who know me, know I have worke enough, and thoſe with whom I live, know, that all the time almoſt I can get for any ſuch eccen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick work I am forced to ſteale from my ſleep.</p>
            <p n="8">8. For my <hi>groſſe deportment</hi> I am charged with, Reader, thou haſt the truth, and the whole truth: Be thou my Judge.</p>
            <p>For his other charges, it is no new thing for the adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries of truth to faſten ſuch termes upon the Patrons of it. Mr <hi>Boatman</hi> muſt impudently defie the Truths, Churches, Servants of the living God, but no body muſt call him to account for it but they muſt be <hi>wranglers,</hi> &amp;c. If that be to <hi>wrangle,</hi> we muſt <hi>wrangle</hi> more.</p>
            <p>He aggravates my <hi>groſſe deportments</hi> (as he cals them) becauſe they concerne him as a GENTLE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MAN, a Chriſtian, and a Miniſter.</p>
            <p>For his being a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> I never heard any ſay he was not baptized, nor ever ſaid any thing tending to that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>For his <hi>Gentlemanſhip</hi>—I was altogether ignorant, (having not ſeen his Pedegree) ſo that I have <hi>Pauls</hi> excuſe, who when he was accuſed for reviling (as they called it) the High Prieſt, excuſed himſelfe by ſaying, <hi>I did not know it was the High Prieſt;</hi> he was never reported to me under that notion; (I confeſſe I am not skilled in Heraldry,) I thinke Gentility comes in by <hi>Conſanguinity,</hi> not <hi>affinity.</hi> But however I do not know that I ſaid or did any thing againſt him which touched his Gentleman-concernments.</p>
            <p>For his being a <hi>Miniſter,</hi> all I can ſay is He is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently
<pb facs="tcp:118834:43"/>reported to me to be none, and that by Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend men, who know what they ſay, and take heed to their words. If he hath been made ſuch by ſome Iriſh Biſhop, or the like, in a corner, ſince the firſt came hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo it is, but I know no reaſon we have to beleeve it, till ſome credible perſons ſee his Letters of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, nor can we (at leaſt till then) eye him as ſuch.</p>
            <p>In the laſt place he tels us, <hi>To love contention is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry far from the ſpirit of</hi> John Boatman <hi>Pastour of</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <hi>in</hi> Norwich.</p>
            <p>For his being <hi>Paſtor of</hi> Peters in <hi>Norwich,</hi> we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not own him as ſuch, till we know at what doore he came in, having great grounds he <hi>climbed up ſome other way;</hi> beſides, there are ſome <hi>ſheep of that flock that will not heare his voice, nor follow him, looking upon him as a ſtranger;</hi> whether he loves Contention or no, let thoſe who read his Sermon judge.</p>
            <p>But thus much ſhall ſerve for his Letter.</p>
            <p>After the receit of which I was reſolved to have done no more but to have betaken my ſelfe to my Study, to ſee if the Church of God had been in an errour theſe 1500 yeares about Suſpenſion. And to my Bible to <hi>ſearch the Scriptures,</hi> to ſee whether it were ſo in very deed as this Doctor had told us that there was no footſteps there to keep any not excommunicated from the Sacrament. But (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all this.) I heard his friends in the Town kept up their old Note, and decried us, as if we were indeed ſuch <hi>Trifles,</hi> and <hi>ſimple fellows,</hi> that none of us durſt grapple with this Champion, and none could induce a perſwaſion in them, that we durſt diſpute, or had made any offer to that purpoſe. Perceiving no other way ſo probably effectuall to ſatisfie people, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Lords day ſoone after, my Sermon being done, before a great Congregation I made a ſhort and mild ſpeech to my people to this purpoſe;</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:118834:44"/>
            <p>
               <hi>That they had known, that it had been the judgement and practice of us who laboured in the worke of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell amongſt them, to ſuſpend the ignorant and ſcandalous from the Supper of the Lord, for which we conceived we had ſufficient ground from the Word of God; and in it we acted but in a conformity to the practice of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and Churches of Chriſt in all Ages, to the practice of the moſt reformed Churches, and this was the declared judgement of our Church ever ſince the very beginnings of Reformation. But in oppoſition they had lately heard it delivered in this City in a publike Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, that for Suſpenſion it was a dreame, yea, a Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaicall dreame, an invention of men to implode Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and thoſe who practiſed it were openly charged as ſuch who would implode Scriptures, lay an intollerable yoake on mens ſhoulders; ſuch who were intruders on Chriſts authority, and did that which entred not into the heads of wiſer Ages, for which was no authority in the Word of God</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and an open challenge was made to us to defend the known judgement of our and other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches, the truth of God (as we hoped it would prove) and our own practice. And I perceived people would not be ſatisfied that any of us durſt encounter him who had ſo defied us, though enough had been done to ſatisfie them. Conſidering therefore that it lay upon us, eſpecially in theſe times, to vindicate the truth, and our practice, and in ſome meaſure our perſons from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of men. That their mouths might be ſtopt, I would read a Letter to them which my ſelfe had ſent him, and the anſwer which the (over-confident) Author of the Challenge returned, by which they might judge whether or no we durſt appeare in the defence of that piece of truth which we beleeved, and according to which we had walked, deſiring them to make no other uſe of the Letter than this, to which purpoſe I read it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this, I read the Letters, how his uncivill Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb facs="tcp:118834:44"/>was reſented there are enough to ſpeake who were preſent.</p>
            <p>After this we heard no more of their <hi>Brags,</hi> only ſome were ſo ſimple as to tell their friends that Mr <hi>Boatman</hi> ſcorned to diſpute here, but if I would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute at the Univerſity in the Schooles he would then anſwer me, either not knowing the order there, or forgetting that Mr <hi>Boatman</hi> is not in a capacity to diſpute there, except in a Sophiſters Gown, upon ſome philoſophicall queſtion.</p>
            <p>This is, Reader, the true Story of this Conteſt: I ſhall refer thee to judge in it; what could we do leſſe than accept his Challenge? And what milder Meſſage than that in my Letter could be ſent to let him know I was ready to accept it?</p>
            <p>Since this, I muſt confeſſe, ſome of his friends have been with me, and told me, that he diſclaimes that he holds any ſuch opinion: As <hi>that none ought to be kept away from the Sacrament but thoſe who are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated;</hi> and that if <hi>I write againſt that opinion it nothing concernes him;</hi> I ſhall but <hi>feigne my ſelfe an Adverſary,</hi> &amp;c. we have nothing to do with what he ſaies in private, his publike declared judgement and practice is contrary; what he ſaid thou haſt read, and he ſaies, <hi>he will juſtifie what he ſaid.</hi> Nay, upon my knowledge he hath maintained it in private too to thoſe he thinks he is able to grapple with. I know he hath in like manner told ſome <hi>Reverend Miniſters, and godly people, that he hath converſed and is acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with all his people;</hi> that he <hi>turnes away many, and admits none without examination, but ſuch as have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore approved,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But how notoriouſly falſe this is (and ſo very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of one who calls himſelfe a Miniſter) we who are upon the place know, and could give him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances (if need were) of ſome notoriouſly ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
<pb facs="tcp:118834:45"/>admitted, but none who were refuſed, (ſo far as I ever upon the ſtricteſt enquiry could heare of) and of ſome who told him they were never at the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament before, but were examined no more than <hi>what is your name? Where dwell you? Are you ſingle or married?</hi> And then they were told, <hi>That he hoped they were fit,</hi> and ſo they were diſmiſſed, (which forme of queſtions is merrily called by ſome Mr <hi>Boat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's</hi> Catechiſme.) This is the ground of my preſent undertaking. Now let me tell thee what thou ſhalt find in the enſuing Tract.</p>
            <p>I have divided it into a Diſcourſe upon three Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1. Whether <hi>Juridicall Suſpenſion,</hi> diſtinct from Excommunication, be <hi>dedueible from Scripture?</hi> I have proved that it is by ſeverall Arguments, upon ſome of which I have enlarged. In the laſt Chapter, on the firſt Queſtion I have put foure or five Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which ſome Reverend Authors have brought, I do not inſiſt much on them, we have no great need of them. I have ſent them out only as <hi>Probationers,</hi> with their Letters of Recommendation from ſome Reverend men, one of them is the iſſue of my crude thoughts concerning the nature of the Sacrament, which I apprehend <hi>ſtrong meat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the handling of that Queſtion thou wilt find one Chapter containing a digreſſion, tending to prove, that <hi>Judas</hi> was neither at the Supper, nor at the eating of the Paſchall Lambe and that he had not then made his compact with the the High Prieſts. And to prove that Chriſt kept the Paſſeover, and inſtituted his Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per two nights before the Jews that yeare, and that he ſuffered the ſecond day after his apprehenſion. Poſſibly in that diſcourſe (which thou mayeſt judge over criticall;) thou maieſt find ſome new Notions; know I am not confident of them, though I ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb facs="tcp:118834:45"/>againſt them, but much ſeemingly for them: If they hold, I hope we ſhall be told no more of <hi>Chriſts giving the Sacrament to Judas,</hi> or of his <hi>eating the Paſſeover,</hi> or <hi>compacting with the High Prieſts before that time;</hi> and ſo being (ſuppoſedly) ſcandalous, (though a ſecret compact would not make him ſo) ſince I finiſhed that diſcourſe, communicating it to a <hi>Reverend</hi> friend; he lent me a criticall diſcourſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the day of Chriſts celebrating the Paſſeover, wrote by <hi>Ludovicus Capellus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

                  <hi>ad amicam in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſe, &amp; Johan. Cloppen. Colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem,</hi> &amp;c. p. 120.</note> in anſwer to <hi>Cloppen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bu gius,</hi> I have read it over. He determines <hi>Scaligers</hi> and <hi>Cauſabons</hi> opinion moſt probable, that Chriſt ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated the Paſſeover that time, not the ſame day the Jews did, the grounds of which he ſhews, <hi>p.</hi> 61, 62. <hi>ad p.</hi> 74.</p>
            <p>Some new Notions he hath about the reaſon of the Jewiſh Tranſlation of the day that yeare, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But I find nothing in him either to eſtabliſh, or (rationally) to deſtroy my opinion. I leave it to thee, Reader, to judge if I have not probabilities on my ſide, and demonſtrations will hardly be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced on any ſide. My Arguments are moſt of them old, only newly reinforced, and vindicated from <hi>Era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus,</hi> Mr <hi>Prin,</hi> Mr <hi>Humfrie's</hi> exceptions; Mr <hi>Boatman</hi> had the diſcretion to take notice of very few Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt him, ſo that I have had little to do with him as to the point of anſwering his Arguments, or Exceptions to ours, (though my whole diſcourſe be directed againſt him (as its proper Antagoniſt) not againſt any of the other) whom I deſire thee to take notice I only ſpeake to as they come acroſſe me, leaving Mr <hi>Humfry</hi> to his proper Adverſaries, (with whom he will find enough to do) I muſt confeſſe, when I firſt entred upon the worke, I intended it againſt none in <hi>hypotheſi,</hi> only in <hi>theſi,</hi> to vindicate our practice, and the practice of other eminent ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
<pb facs="tcp:118834:46"/>of Chriſt, yea, and of the Churches of God in all Ages, eſpecially our late reformed Churches, not med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling with Mr <hi>Boatman,</hi> nor did I want perſwaſions to it from ſome learned men, who wondred what I would anſwer, conſidering he had only Magiſterially maintained his opinion, baſely aſperſing the ſervants and Churches of God as <hi>dreamers, imploders of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> &amp;c. and had not brought any thing towards the proofe of it, but a few looſe paſſages which you could not go about to mould into a Syllogiſme, but you would ſcare them out of common ſenſe.</p>
            <p>This made me at firſt reſolve only to write againſt the opinion, and to have pleaded the cauſe <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, without any preamble, (as they were wont to do at <hi>Areopagus.</hi>) But others were of another opinion; yet this courſe had I taken, conſidering he made it his worke ſo conſtantly to deny that privately which he had ſpoken publikely, and to diſown his opinion as often as he met with any godly Miniſters of another mind; (this he did to Mr <hi>Corhet</hi> of this Country, and to divers others) who told me of it againe. In the meane time in his own Congregation he ſtill cries it up, and ſufficiently beſpatters us who were of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſwaſion; witneſſe his Sermon, preached the fifteenth of <hi>February</hi> 1653. at <hi>Peters,</hi> upon <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.17. from which Text he had taken a great deale of paines to teach his people how to know others that were hypocrites (an Art, I beleeve, few Divines but himſelf are much skill'd in.) In that Sermon he gave them ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Notes to know Chriſtians that were ſpiritually proud: his ſecond note was this:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They cannot endure that any body but themſelves ſhould have any Goſpell-priviledges allowed them, unleſſe ſuch as are common to Jews, Heathens, and Pagans. Indeed they may heare, and they may come to thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon promiſcuous Ordinances (as they call them) but
<pb facs="tcp:118834:46"/>they muſt have no right to the Sacrament. That muſt be for ſuch, and ſuch, and many times none in the world worſe than they; I ſpeake to thoſe that are guilty of theſe crimes, not to thoſe who are not; doubtleſſe many a man is unſatisfied, and we muſt beare with the weake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If this be not plaine enough I know not what is; here are at once all the eminent Servants and Churches of God of former Ages, and our Age, branded as ſpiritually proud hypocrites, becauſe they durſt not admit all to the Sacrament; yea, and all Chriſtians branded who are tender of their Communion in that Ordinance. Some of them are ſuch as <hi>there are none in the world worſe than they;</hi> The reſt are <hi>weake,</hi> and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be borne with. <hi>Reader,</hi> I ſhall refer it to thee to judge whether our ſilence now were not a coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſerting the cauſe of God, and of all Reformed Churches. I might tell thee more, that it is much ſuſpected by ſome, who fear God, in this City, that it is the whole deſign of his preaching, to ſtir up animoſities in a profane Party againſt thoſe who are of ſtricter Principles, and to brand all ſtrict Chriſtians as Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites and Formaliſts, (the uſuall Alehouſe-termes for thoſe againſt whom they have nothing elſe to ſay;) What meane elſe theſe unſavoury paſſages in his ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Sermons? <hi>Some have an art to ſqueake out Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> (by that neat terme he expounded <hi>Luthers cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare Chriſtum,</hi>) which I had thought had been to crack, and make a vaine boaſt of Chriſt. And againe, <hi>The whining Chriſtians are thoſe who have been the ruin of Religion.</hi> And againe, <hi>Pride and Covetouſneſſe are the Saints great Sins.</hi> And againe, <hi>For a drunkard, or debaucht wretch I could hug him in my boſome, when I would ſpit in the face of an envious Profeſſour.</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe I heare none of this ſtuffe, but I ſhall refer thee to thoſe godly perſons, who have ſometimes heard
<pb facs="tcp:118834:47"/>him, to enquire whether theſe things be true, I have heard them againe and againe, ſome of them have ſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red away ſome of his godly Auditors, and others of them have frighted away others. Beſides, that ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry expreſſion which is his uſuall complement with his people before a Sacrament: They ſhall not be dealt with <hi>in the phariſaicall way.</hi> Theſe things are not ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in ſecret, but in a Pulpit, yea, and in the greateſt Congregation of the City. The Lord in mercy look upon us, our condition is ſad enough. I ſhall adde to all this one thing yet more.</p>
            <p>A Reverend Brother in this City, begging my aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, to preach his Lecture the twenty third of <hi>March</hi> laſt, he having before entreated me, that if I had any thing ready on the Subject, I would preach ſomething about Suſpenſion at ſome time in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation. I that day preached for him, and for my Sermon took that Text, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.6. and preached my firſt Argument on the firſt Queſtion, there thou wilt find all the doctrinall part of my Sermon. I left out every Syllable which might make my diſcourſe unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to any, and (as all my hearers will judge) I had not the leaſt reflexion upon any; only having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, <hi>That that Text was not to be reſtrained to this or that Ordinance, but to be underſtood of all Ordinances, all which are there forbidden to be diſpenſed to ſuch as the Scripture calls dogs or ſwine in other places, (except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only ſuch Ordinances as the Scripture elſewhere ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly allows to be given to dogs,)</hi> I concluded by way of Application.</p>
            <p>I inferred, <hi>If that were truth, then there was a plaine Scripture-prohibition (though not</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">

Becauſe there is no other Scripture allows the giving it out to dogs. 3. This <hi>Scripture forbids,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:118834:47"/>
            <p>The Lords day after I heard Mr <hi>Boatman</hi> intended to confute me the next Tueſday; ſome occaſions drew me out of Town, but upon the Tueſday he aimed at it, taking my very Text; how well he confuted me, my Reader may judge by reading my firſt Argument on my firſt queſtion, and then his Sermon which I have annexed at the latter end of my Tract, and my Notes upon it. I beleeve there was never ſuch a buſineſſe delivered in order to a confuting; yet for feare that a clamorous party ſhould cry it up confuted, I have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed it, having the Notes of it given me by a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and judicious man, who was his Auditor that day, and took the Sermon from him, and will juſtifie the Notes.</p>
            <p>Theſe things, Reader, made me take up a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to give thee an account of the whole buſineſſe, and openly to engage Mr <hi>Boatman</hi> as my proper An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoniſt; and the rather, becauſe <hi>Theophilus Brabourne</hi> hath ſent me word, that if I will write, he will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend Mr <hi>Boatman;</hi> (for every one he ſaith is not fit for diſputing, but he will do it,) one would thinke he were not very fit that ſhould read his laſt books. I ſent him anſwer, I hoped to find him work enough to defend his own; but if he be ſo good at it, he ſhall find we are able to employ him. That therefore Mr <hi>Boatman</hi> may know what he hath to do, and Mr <hi>Brabourne</hi> may have ſomething to do (now he hath taken his hand from the Plough, which many, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, never thought him f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t for, though the Biſhops judged otherwiſe) I have engaged in this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie in the defence of all the eminent Saints and Servants of God of former Ages, other Reformed Churches, and our own Church, and of that Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Aſſembly, ſo boldly aſperſed both by Mr <hi>Boat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> and Mr <hi>Brabourne,</hi> in which my ſelfe knew ſo many holy, and <hi>learned,</hi> and <hi>Reverend men,</hi> that I
<pb facs="tcp:118834:48"/>beleeve, ſince the <hi>Nicene</hi> Councill, there was never ſo many, and ſo holy, and learned men met in any Eccleſiaſticall Councill: Some of whom I know would not turne their heads in any point of Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from the moſt learned Hereticks that are, or ever were in <hi>Chriſtendome;</hi> and having ſuch an opinion of that eminent Aſſembly, I hope thou wilt pardon me, Reader, if I take their part in what was their decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Judgement, eſpecially againſt two ſuch Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries as theſe are, with whom it is far more fit that ſome of their youngeſt Sons ſhould diſpute than themſelves, leaving thoſe Fathers to grapple with more learned and conſiderable Adverſaries. I am one of the yongeſt ſons of thoſe <hi>Reverend Prophets,</hi> but yet I have a little duty for them, and ſhall engage for <hi>Norfolke</hi> or <hi>Norwich,</hi> to attempt at leaſt their vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation from any who ſhall in theſe parts appeare in publike againſt what was (according to Gods Word) agreed upon by them, (if he hath not a proper Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, and if I be not over-powred by Legions of Pamphlets.) But I returne to my former Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Queſtion I have ſpoken to, is: <hi>Whether Miniſteriall, or privative Suſpenſion be juſtifiable or no?</hi> I have on purpoſe ſpoken to this, partly, becauſe I heare ſome ſay this was Mr <hi>Boatman's</hi> meaning, (though he reſtrained not himſelfe ſo by any paſſage) and if it be, how doth he tell others that he doth keep away ſome himſelfe? But that he might not have this refuge, I have ſpoke a little to that. I confeſſe, it is a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der point which many godly men are diſ-ſatisfied in, <hi>Whether, in caſe there wants a Presbytery in the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, the Miniſter may keep back any by his own power, or rather ought to adminiſter it to all?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the firſt place, I deſire my Reader to obſerve, that thoſe who are of the Epiſcopall perſwaſion, and own no Congregationall Presbyteries (which is Mr <hi>Boat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:118834:48"/>judgement they ſay) make not this queſtion, but alwaies took the Affirmative for granted; witneſs the Schoolemen, Canoniſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Rubrick to the Book of Common Prayer, the Canons agreed on in the Synod at <hi>London,</hi> 1603.</p>
            <p>Some of my Reverend and learned Fathers and Brethren of the Presbyterian perſwaſion indeed ſcruple it, becauſe they think all Suſpenſion is an act of Rule, and the Rule of the Church belongs to the Miniſter and Elders, amongſt whom is <hi>Reverend</hi> and learned Mr <hi>Jeanes,</hi> (whom though I know not, yet I honour for his learned Tract on that Subject, and for his Midwifry in helping into the world that laſt piece of our great and learned <hi>Twiſſe.</hi>) I crave leave to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in this point from thoſe few of my Brethren who are ſo perſwaded, and conceive, that to avoid promiſcuous Communion, the Miniſter may in ſome caſes ſuſpend his own act, though not formally paſſe a Cenſure, yea, and I thinke he ought. Though I confeſſe, when the ſtate of the Church is ſuch that this cannot be done without a neceſſary and great breach of the peace of it, the caſe is more diſputable, becauſe the Amity and Edification of the Church is the high end of all Church-Cenſures. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his third book <hi>contra Epiſtolam Parmeniani,</hi> and in many other places thinkes Church Cenſures ſhould be ſpared, when the Major part of the Church is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, and the execution of Cenſures may cauſe Schiſmes, and much he ſaies for it.</p>
            <p>But I muſt confeſſe, I am of <hi>Peter Martyrs</hi> mind. — <hi>Iſte Auguſtini timor nimius videtur, quaſi debea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus verbum Dei relinquere, ut ſchiſmata &amp; tumult us evitemus: ſequamur quod praecipit Deus, eventus autem providentiae illius committamus.</hi> He anſwers all which <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith for his opinion, and concludes, <hi>That it were better to have leſſer Churches than ſo large and
<pb facs="tcp:118834:49"/>ample ones defiled.</hi> But I ſhall not diſpute that buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In the laſt place I have enquired what hath been the judgement of the eminent Servants and Churches of Chriſt in all Ages. Having firſt enquired our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers mind, the Judgement and practice of our El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Brethren is not inconſiderable, eſpecially when we are charged with <hi>Innovation,</hi> and doing that <hi>(which never entred into the heads of wiſer Ages.)</hi> I have proved, that it hath been the practice of the Church in all Ages, the Judgement of our Church, before, and ever ſince the Reformation, and of all reformed Churches in the World, ſome Churches of the Proteſtant <hi>Switzers</hi> only excepted.</p>
            <p>And now <hi>(Reader)</hi> I ſhall caſt my ſelfe upon thy Charity. I hope thou wilt excuſe me for my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking. The zeale of the Lords houſe for the precious body and bloud of Jeſus Chriſt hath eaten me up, as to this point. Had not we been openly challenged, the judgement and practice of the Churches and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God openly aſperſed, I ſhould have found other worke to do beſides engaging Mr <hi>Boatman.</hi> I have given thee here a faithfull and impartiall Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative of the Originall and Progreſſe of this Conteſt. If Mr <hi>Brabourne</hi> be at the Charge to reply, I deſire thee not to expect my anſwer; I beleeve thou wilt (whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thou art) be able thy ſelf to anſwer what he can ſay; I ſhall leave him to one more fit for him, (having been ſufficiently chidden by ſome learned Friends for loſing ſo much time as to meddle with his other peece.) But if Mr <hi>Boatman</hi> anſwers, and either denies any thing here ſaid as matter of fact, or makes ſuch a reply to any Arguments as any Licencer of the Preſſe will let paſſe, I ſhall reply to him, and prove whatever ſhall be denied, and make good my Arguments, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded he confutes them better than he did my Sermon.</p>

            <p>I ſhall keep thee no longer in the Porch, but give thee leave to enter; Read, and then judge, and pray for this poore City, where are ſo many thouſand ſoules, and ſo few fit to take charge of them. The Lord keep thee <hi>(Reader)</hi> in theſe evill times from the errours of them, and an ever lover both of Goſpell-purity, and Unity. So praies</p>

               <p n="2">2. <hi>Deducible from Scripture or Reaſon,</hi> that is <hi>the predicate</hi> in queſtion betwixt us.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As to <hi>Suſpenſion of ſome perſons from the Supper;</hi> wee meane no more then a denyall of that Ordinance to ſome. This ſuſpenſion is uſually diſtinguiſhed into <hi>Juridicall</hi> and <hi>Paſtorall,</hi> or <hi>privative</hi> and <hi>poſitive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Poſitive ſuſpenſion,</hi> which is called Juridicall, <hi>is an act of the Officers of the Church, whereby (having had due cogriſance of the party that deſires the Supper of the Lord, and finding him unfit, or unworthy) though he hath formerly been admitted; Yet they by vertue of the truſt repoſed by Chriſt in them, warne him to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:118834:51"/>from the Lords Table, and deny the Ordinance to him if he intrudes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Privative <hi>Suſpenſion,</hi> which I alſo call <hi>paſtorall,</hi> is an act of the Miniſter of the <hi>Goſpell, whereby hee alone (the Church wanting other Officers) finding ſome perſons (though formerly admitted) not able to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine themſelves, or unworthy in reſpect of open ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall to come to that Holy Table, doth not only as their Paſtor, admoniſh them to forbeare, but withholds the elements from them, if they preſume to come to the Lords Table.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God willing I ſhall anon ſpeake to the ſecond of theſe: whether privative ſuſpenſion be lawfull or no. But that is not my preſent buſineſſe. But ſuppoſing there be an elderſhip conſtituted in a Congregation, whether this elderſhip may keep away any from the Lords Table, for ignorance or knowne ſcandall, if he be a Chriſtian, and not <hi>de facto, Excommunicated.</hi> This is that which Mr <hi>Boatman</hi> cals a <hi>Phariſaicall dreame;</hi> an <hi>uſurpation of Chriſts authority,</hi> a <hi>thing not deducible from Scripture.</hi> That which he <hi>humbly</hi> (and boldly) <hi>challengeth</hi> all the Miniſters on Earth to make good. (if he durſt have ſtood to his word)</p>
               <p n="2">2. Nor could his meaning bee any thing elſe; For in his Congregation there is an <hi>elderſhip</hi> eſtabliſhed according to Ordinance of Parliament, by a due ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the major part of the Congregation preſent after publike notice given three Lords daies each af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter other, which he hath throwne downe, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſheth this Doctrine, that he might prepare his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for a proſtitution of that ſacred Ordinance.</p>
               <p>As to the ſecond terme, <hi>Deducible from Scripture,</hi> I take it for granted, that my indifferent Reader will grant me that to be ſufficiently deduced and proved from Scripture, which is evinced from it by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary

                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>Let us examine all theſe three a little.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Q. <hi>What holy things are here ſpoken of.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is a good rule, <hi>Where the Law doth not diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, we ſhould not.</hi> Our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt ſpeakes not of this or that <hi>Holy thing;</hi> but ſayes <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; and it is a bold preſumption in us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine it without Scripture-warrant.</p>
               <p>I think therefore every ſober Chriſtian will grant me theſe two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> That all thoſe <hi>holy things and Pearles are here forbidden to be given to Dogs, and caſt before Swine, which the Scripture doth not elſwhere plainly allow to be given to Dogs or Swine;</hi> elſe they will be obliged to ſhew us another ground of reſtraint.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> I hope <hi>it will eaſily be granted to concerne ſuch holy things as God hath betruſted us to give out:</hi> for it is to men Chriſt ſpeakes.</p>
               <p>Things are called holy in Scripture, upon a foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold account.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>In reſpect of conſecration, when a thing is ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part for Gods ſervice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>In reſpect of inherent purity.</hi> Thus God is holy, and his grace as holy.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In reſpect of <hi>a divine ſignature and impreſſion upon them.</hi> Thus every command and every Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God is holy.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In reſpect of a deſignation, and ſubſerviency of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:118834:53"/>it to an holy uſe or end; in this ſence alſo are all the Ordinances of God holy. And doubtleſſe, theſe are the holy things here ſpoken of: and ſo all grant.</p>
               <p>Upon the two laſt accounts, (ſaith <hi>Chemnitius</hi>) the Ordinances of God are rightly called holy. Now the Ordinances of God are of two ſorts.</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>Private.</hi> 2 <hi>Publick.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chemnit. <hi>harm. cap.</hi> 51.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Private Ordinances are <hi>inſtitutions of Chriſt</hi> to be performed by <hi>private perſons,</hi> either in order to <hi>Gods glory,</hi> or our brethrens good, ſuch are private <hi>inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> and <hi>exhortations</hi> each of other. <hi>Private prayer;</hi> private <hi>admonitions,</hi> frequently commanded by God in Scripture. The publike Ordinances are, publike <hi>preaching and expounding Scripture before the Church,</hi> performed by perſons in Office to it, <hi>publike Prayer, Church cenſures,</hi> &amp;c. It is without all queſtion, that the Ordinances of God, are the <hi>Holy things here for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to be given to Dogs, or caſt before Swine.</hi> But the queſtion is, whether all theſe <hi>Holy things be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden</hi> here to be ſo caſt, or onely ſome?</p>
               <p>I ſay there is no reaſon, but we ſhould underſtand all thoſe <hi>Ordinances,</hi> which in other <hi>places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, are not commanded to be given to all.</hi> My reaſon is this; becauſe it is boldneſſe in us to reſtraine what God hath not limited.</p>
               <p>And hence I perceive, that ſome, who have been inclined to thinke, that ſome one Ordinance is eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <hi>meant here;</hi> yet dare not exclude others.</p>
               <p>So Mr <hi>Jeanes,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And <hi>Chemnitius</hi> determines it an unjuſt reſtriction to reſtraine it to reproofe. Beſides that, admonition

               </p>
               <p>I know <hi>Thomas Eraſtus</hi> tels us it muſt be meant of Preaching the word. But beſides that, <hi>there is no ground in the Text</hi> for this, there is leſſe in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Scripture. For the Word muſt be preached to <hi>Heathens, Mat.</hi> 28. and much more to them who are but as <hi>Heathens;</hi> and to ſcandalous ſinners; Nor is there any reaſon to appropriate this <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to the word onely.</p>
               <p>It ſeemes to me, that our Saviour had an eſpeciall eye to Sacramentall Ordinances, not onely becauſe in other Scriptures there is an expreſſe command, to admit the moſt ſorts of Dogs to heare the word: but alſo becauſe if any one Ordinance may be called more holy then other, it is this of the Supper; which is, <hi>The new Teſtament in his blood. The Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the body and blood of Chriſt.</hi> But to ſay this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance is excluded, is not onely to ſpeake contrary to Scripture, but to common ſenſe too. Which made <hi>Eraſtus</hi> in the ſame thefis, thinke it ſafer to inſiſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a diſtinction of <hi>Dogs,</hi> then adhere to his firſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of holy things.</p>
               <p>This Scripture therefore uſing a generall terme, which is not reſtrained by any preceding or ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent words, and no other Scripture plainly allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>holy thing</hi> of the <hi>Lords ſupper to be given to Swine and Dogs,</hi> I conceive he that deſires his words, may goe along with the truth, and beare a proportion to his owne reaſon, (if he be endued with ſo much as an humane ſoule, doth intitle all but mad men and fooles unto) will not ſay but that the Lords Supper is here couched at leaſt in the number of the holy
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:118834:54"/>things and pearles here ſpecified.</p>
               <p>Eſpecially when I ſhall have made it evident, by the different applications of this Scripture amongſt the Ancients, and large expoſitions of it, by Moderne ſober Writers; That they thought not the holy things here ſpoken of, were <hi>Admonition</hi> or <hi>Preaching</hi> onely, but other holy adminiſtrations alſo.</p>

               <p n="1">1. That by <hi>Dogs and Swine</hi> here are not means thoſe Beaſts we call ſo. I ſuppoſe will eaſily be granted me by any, that conſiders how needleſſe ſuch a prohibition would have been.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We muſt therefore acknowledge a Metaphor, and that the creatures to whom (in this place) holy things are here forbidden to be given, are ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,

All the queſtion will be, what thoſe vitious qualifications are upon which our Saviour cals ſome here <hi>Dogs</hi> and <hi>Swine.</hi>

               <p>Theſe things therefore premiſed, let us now come to a ſtrict enquiry for the meaning of this place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eraſtus</hi> thinks, that the Dogs are ſufficiently chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cterized in the Text.</p>
               <p>To this purpoſe he tels us, that Chriſt ſpeaks of them who deſpiſe Pearles, and trample them under their feet, and turning againe teare us; that is of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Church. For whom he ſaith he pleadeth not to the ſame purpoſe I perceive. Thoſe reverend men alſo ſpeaking, who underſtand this Text chiefly of the preaching the Goſpel, and of Admonition.</p>
               <p>But I ſhall propound a few conſiderations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That perſecutors are Dogs and Swine, none will
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:118834:56"/>deny; but the queſtion is, whether they be the only <hi>Dogs</hi> here ſpoken of.</p>
               <p n="2">2. According to <hi>Eraſtus;</hi> if there be in the Church then, one that is an enemy of it, one who contemnes the Ordinances, and perſecutes the ſervants of Chriſt, he ought to be ſuſpended the Sacrament, (though not excommunicate) Then according to <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> there is ſuch a thing as ſuſpenſion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Though Perſecutors be properly called Dogs for their rending and tearing, yet for this they are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly called <hi>Swine,</hi> for Swine doe not uſe to teare, but we muſt not <hi>caſt Pearles before Swine.</hi> Who are the Swine ſaith Mr <hi>Rutherford,</hi> and his learned Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If they be deſcribed in the Text,
<note place="margin">Gilleſpy. <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons rod. c.</hi> 15.</note> it is by a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble character. Firſt, <hi>trampling upon the holy things.</hi> Secondly, <hi>turning againe, and rending the givers.</hi> The firſt is proper to <hi>Swine,</hi> the ſecond to <hi>Dogs.</hi> So then we are not to give holy things any more to ſuch, that will trample them under their feet, then to them who will turne againe and teare us.</p>
               <p n="5">5. We deſire no more ſhould be ſuſpended, then wil come under theſe two notions; ſuch as will but <hi>tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the Ordinance under their feet,</hi> or ſuch as will <hi>turn againe and rend us.</hi> All unbeleevers will doe the firſt, we are ſure.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, There are thoſe that doubt whether the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of the Text be Exegeticall of the former, and ſay, the terme <hi>leſt</hi> doth infer a commination or threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to thoſe who give <hi>holy things to Dogs and Swine,</hi> wherein the Lord threatens, that if they doe it, the iſſue will be, 1. Thoſe perſons contempt of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance. 2. Turning their Miniſters enemies, and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them, being (through the juſt judgement of God) the <hi>Avengers of his holy Ordinance upon them.</hi> Who ſhall ſo preſume to proſtitute it.</p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:118834:57"/>
               <p>I confeſſe I did not ſo much value this interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the words,

                  </note> (though I know they will beare it) till I found <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> expreſſing ſo much as if he had ſome ſuch thoughts of them, and fetching a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon from this Text; why the Miniſters of the Goſpell in his time, were ſo lamentably deſpiſed and perſecuted, becauſe they had given the holy Sacrament to profane perſons; and while I had this Notion in my head, <hi>A Revered Brother in this Country</hi> was with me, and told me he had found it true in his owne experience, in a woman of the Pariſh, of which he was Miniſter, who lately dying in a ſad condition, and under much (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed) guilt, charged his adminiſtration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to her, as the great meanes of her hardning in ſinne, which was no little wound to this godly mans ſpirit. Since, A Merchant of London hath told me of Mr <hi>Simmonds</hi> (ſometimes of <hi>Iron-mongers Lane</hi> in London) going to viſit one that was ſick, and to whom he had a little before given the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, and queſtioning with her, about her eternall Salvation; ſhee askt him upon what account he came now to queſtion her upon that, whereas himſelfe a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before had aſſured her that <hi>the body of the Lord Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt was broken for her;</hi> which (ſaith my Author (as I remember from Mr <hi>Simmond</hi>'s mouth) ſo woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him, that he had almoſt ſuncke downe in the room, (which two ſtories may anſwer that one which Mr <hi>Humfry</hi> hath borrowed from Mr <hi>Fairclough,</hi> and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in his rejoinder to Dr <hi>Drake</hi>) we need not go ſo far. What makes the profane and looſe party in moſt of the congregations of <hi>England</hi> this day, ſo hate &amp; revile their godly Miniſters this day, and endeavour to get them out, (becauſe they dare no more give the Sacrament to them) But this their former ſin in giving the holy thing of the Sacrament to theſe Dogs and Swine formerly. I would faine know ſaith Mr <hi>George Gilleſpy,</hi> what
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:118834:57"/>fruit godly Miniſters find of their former promiſcuous adminiſtrations, but <hi>ageneral hardning of heart amongſt their people,</hi> and a bleſſing of themſelves in a ſuppoſed good condition, becauſe they are adminiſtred to all the priviledges of Saints, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>The truth, is both Mr <hi>Humfry,</hi> and Mr <hi>Boatman,</hi> had it from <hi>Eraſtus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eraſt <hi>theſis.</hi> 64.</note> or the ſame ſpirit at leaſt. He was the firſt worker in this ſort of Braſſe; and what they ſay amounts to the ſame with his—<hi>Quos eccleſia ita judicavit.</hi> But let us ſee to how little purpoſe this is ſaid.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Text is plaine, that holy things are not to be given to <hi>Dogs or Swine.</hi> Now, I never knew that the ſhutting of a Dog out of the houſe, made him a Dog, I had thought he muſt have been a Dog firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had been ſhut out of the houſe, but this Mr <hi>Humfry</hi> grants, onely not uſed like Dogs before.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Our queſtion is, what are <hi>thoſe Dogs</hi> here ſpoken of, whether theſe who have <hi>vitia canina,</hi> the beaſtly qualities of Dogs, or thoſe onely who have the <hi>ill hap of Dogs,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Petitio principij</note> to be turn'd out of doors. I had thought that this Text had been brought to have proved, that thoſe who have the nature and beaſtly qualities of Dogs, ſhould be uſed like Dogs, and not have childrens bread given to them.</p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:118834:60"/>
               <p n="3">3. If excommunicate perſons be meant here, ſurely this Text, or ſome other muſt juſtify the uſage of this Metaphor, in that ſence. But let Mr <hi>Humfry</hi> ſhew us but one Text of Scripture, where this terme <hi>Dogs</hi> is uſed to expreſſe excommunicate perſons, or let him ſhew us any thing in the Text to enforce it here, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we muſt tell him the Scripture cals all <hi>prophane ſiners</hi> Dogs, <hi>thoſe who returne with the Dog to the vomit, and with the Swine to wallow in the mire,</hi> are Dogs and Swine in the Scripture ſenſe; but I find ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate perſons call'd ſo no where upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their excommunication.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Nor is there any one Author on his ſide, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver I met with, ſo that his interpretation is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Scripture, Reaſon, and all Expoſitors.</p>
               <p>But yet we ſay, though the Sacrament be denied <hi>to Dogs and Swine,</hi> becauſe they are ſo, not becauſe they are ſhut out of the houſhold of God by excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet in regard that man can judge but according to the outward appearance, they muſt firſt appeare to be ſo, before the Ordinance can be denied to them. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret things belong to God.</hi> But to ſay that by Dogs here are only meant perſons actually excommunicate, is a meer ſhift to avoid a ſtrong argument, and but an idle dreams, which hath no reality of truth in it, and is juſtifiable neither from this Text nor any other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>But theſe men who are ſo zealous for the profana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an Ordinance, are obſerved very lazy as to the preſerving the purity of Ordinances. <hi>They muſt be excommunicated,</hi> before you keep them from the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, (ſaith Mr <hi>Boatman</hi>) ſo ſaies Mr <hi>Humfry,</hi> but why doc not theſe tender men then, take a courſe to declare ſuch to be Dogs and Swine, as are ſo, and to caſt them out? Mr <hi>Boatman</hi> hath an Elderſhip eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in his congregation, why did he not firſt call them
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:118834:61"/>together, and inquire the ſtate of his flock, and caſt out ſuch as might have been found Dogs or Swine? if he thinks they muſt be excommunicated firſt, (we are not ſo haſty in that dreadfull ſentence.) What is Mr <hi>Humfries</hi> caſe I cannot tell, but their principles (and the practiſe of one of them at leaſt) makes ſome think that they will never take any courſe to find out who be Swine or Dogs, and declare them ſuch: (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſuch Dogs as have loſt their tailes, and cannot fawne enough on them) But very zealous they are to declare that all Dogs (that are not hang'd by excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication) muſt be fed with the childrens bread. <hi>The Lord forgive them this iniquity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 We have ſeen what is meant by <hi>holy things,</hi> and have proved, that there is no reaſon to exclude the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Lords Supper.</hi> We have alſo ſhewed, who are meant <hi>by Dogs.</hi> There remaines onely to be conſidered, to whom this precept is given. Surely all will grant me; <hi>To thoſe who have holy things to give, thoſe whom God hath betruſted with the diſpenſation of his Ordinances unto others.</hi> I ask no more, and will not enter into a debate here, who theſe are; whether the <hi>Miniſter</hi> alone, or the whole <hi>Preſbytery,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>So then the ſenſe of this place is this;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You whom I have betruſted with the diſpenſation of my holy Ordinances, take heed you doe not diſpenſe any of them out to impure ſinners, who will but trample up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and teare you, excepting onely ſuch of my Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances as I</hi> (appointed them as proper meanes for their converſion) <hi>have other where expreſly comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded you to give unto them.</hi> Nor is that any unjuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able interpretation for that precept, <hi>thou ſhalt not kill, muſt be underſtood</hi> with exception of thoſe, whom as Magiſtrates executing Juſtice, or Souldiers fighting Gods Battles, are commanded to kill, and the whole Word of God is his Law, no piece of which contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth other.</p>

               </p>
               <p>I ſhall now ſhut up this firſt Argument, it amounts to thus much.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>The holy Sacrament of the Lords Supper, is one of thoſe holy things which our Saviour Chriſt in Mat.</hi> 7.6. <hi>forbids us to give unto Dogs, or to caſt before Swine.</hi> They have the nature of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, there is no reaſon to exclude them; Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors generally have ſo judged.</q>

                  <hi>Men of impure lives and converſations, are Dogs and Swine in Scripture phraſe, and ſuch as will trample upon the Ordinance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It will be an eaſie concluſion. <hi>If God hath requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thoſe whom he hath betruſted with his holy things, not to give them out to ſuch as his word de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes to be Dogs and Swine,</hi> then <hi>(though there may be ſome in the Church not yet excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated) yet they ought not to have the holy thing of the Sacrament given to them.</hi> But I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved this to be the will of Chriſt from this Text —Ergo</p>

                  </note> I find indeed a third ſenſe of the words hinted, by ſome reverend Expoſitors. <hi>You cannot drink of the cup of the Lord, and of the cup of Devils. You cannot eat of the Table of the Lord, and of the Table of Devils.</hi> That is, (ſay they) though you may enjoy an outward Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in the Ordinance, yet you cannot enjoy an inward ſpirituall Communion with Chriſt in it. As <hi>Auguſtine</hi> (ſuppoſing <hi>Judas</hi> was at the Lords Supper) ſaith that he did eat <hi>Panem Domins,</hi> but not <hi>Panem Dominum.</hi> But I think Learned <hi>Beza</hi> ſaith ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againſt this ſenſe, when he tels us, that by the <hi>Table</hi> is meant the <hi>Elements upon the Table,</hi> and by the <hi>cup,</hi> the wine in the <hi>cup.</hi> If the Apoſtle had ſaid, you cannot eat the fleſh, and <hi>drink the blood of Chriſt,</hi> if you have fellowſhip with De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, the Apoſtle might poſſibly have been ſo interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but his Argument is plainly to prove the unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of their comming to the Table, being guilty of ſuch ſinns.</p>
               <p>But the ſumme of all amounts to this; that thoſe who cannot drink the cup, and eat at the Table of the Lord, (in the ſenſe of this Text) are either,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Such as God hath forbidden comming to that Ordinance.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:118834:64"/>
               <p>Or ſecondly ſuch, as if they ſuſh upon the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, yet can have no Communion with Chriſt, no benefit by it. I will take it in either ſenſe, and I ſay</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is ſinfull for any to adminiſter the Ordinance of the Supper to thoſe whom he knowes to be ſuch, as are forbidden to meddle with it, or whom he knowes to be ſuch as conſidering their preſent ſtate, cannot have Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Chriſt in it.</hi> This I hope will eaſily be proved.</p>
               <p>For ſurely it will be granted, that it is ſinfull for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to give it to thoſe to whom he is not <hi>commanded to give it,</hi> for he is the ſteward of the myſteries of God, and muſt expect his maſters order before he deales them out, nor will it be enough to ſay he is not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, for his very Office forbids him, and in that he is not commanded he is expreſly forbidden.</p>
               <p>Now, a Miniſter is not commanded, any where ſurely, to give it to thoſe who are forbidden to receive it. To ſay no more in this caſe: I hope we have all too reverent thoughts of the wiſdome of God, to think that he ſhould lay his Miniſter under an obligation to adminiſter his Ordinance to thoſe whom he hath warned upon pain of damnation not to take it.</p>
               <p>Though this were enough, (for thoſe who encline to the other ſenſe, doe cleerly yet grant, that thoſe who partook of the Table of Devils, are here either forbidden that Table, or the Lords Table, which (if it be true, as queſtionleſſe it is) our Adverſaries muſt maintaine that they are commanded to give the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament to thoſe whom the ſame God forbids to take it) yet poſſibly the other part may be more diſputable, <hi>viz.</hi>

               <p>The major is plaine enough: the minor is as cleere, if we conſider when or how an Ordinance is profaned or abuſed. <hi>Her Prieſts have violated my Law, and have profaned my holy things, they have put no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the holy and the profane, neither have they ſhewed difference between the unclean and the clean.</hi> Ezek. 22.26.

               <p>But ſecondly let us obſerve what fellowſhip theſe <hi>Corinthians</hi> had with Devils; they did not make a compact with Devils, they did not worſhip the Devill as ſome Idolaters; the buſineſſe was only this: They being Members of a Goſpell Church, did eat at Banquets of thoſe Meates, which were before ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed to their Idols, they did not ſacrifice with them, but only <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. After the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters had been ſacrificing, they came to their Feaſts, ſimply to eat the meat was nothing, nor had the Idol made it worſe, and had it been ſold in the Shambles the Apoſtle determined before, that they might have bought it, and eat it; that which altered the caſe, was onely the ſhew that it made to the Idolaters of their
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:118834:66"/>complying with them, and the circumſtances of time and place; yet the Apoſtle determines this a fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with Devils and Idolatry, ſuch a ſin as they who are guilty of it, could have no communion with Chriſt in this Ordinance. Suppoſe they had made a compact with the Devill, or gone and worſhipped the Idols, ſurely the Apoſtle would much more have ſaid it of ſuch.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I cannot ſee but every ſcandalous ſinner, every Drunkard, Swearer, Adulterer, &amp;c. hath as great a fellowſhip with Devils, as the Corinthians had.</p>
               <p>One thing I deſire you to obſerve. There might be latent grace in theſe Corinthians hearts, and doubtleſs was, yet while they lay under this ſcandall, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle determines that they were ſuch as could not eat at the Table, nor drink of the cup of the Lord. Whence I conclude, <hi>That there may be ſuch in a Church, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning whom it may be knowne that they cannot eat at the Lords Table, nor drink the Lords cup.</hi> It will not be enough to ſay, that God may give them repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for ought we know at the time, or upon their receiving. In the mean time, till their repentance bee evident, they may be knowne, and ought to be judged by us, as ſuch as cannot eat at the Lords Table, nor drink the Lords cup.</p>

               <p>It remains therefore that we expound it by. <hi>Iſ.</hi> 25.6. where the Lord promiſes to make a <hi>Feaſt of fat things.</hi> By which he promiſeth all Goſpell-Ordinances, and a Goſpell-Communion with his people.

Firſt therefore I ſay</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Lords Supper is a part of the Goſpell-Feaſt, and the onely proper Feaſt of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The relation this Text hath to the Paſseover ſeemes to me to prove it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It was doubtleſs chiefly in reference to this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion that the Church was to be purged for ſome civill Communion, and ſome Communion with an inceſtuous perſon in other Ordinances may be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>But if we ſhould admit this, that the meaning were, that we ſhould not in our converſation have Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:118834:70"/>with ſcandalous ſinners. I ſee no harme at all would follow upon it. For ſurely if we ought not to converſe with ſuch in our civill converſation, much leſs is it lawfull for us to have Communion with ſuch at the Lords Table. And ſurely if it be unlawfull for Chriſtians to have Communion with ſuch (though in the Church) it is unlawfull for the Officers of the Church to admit ſuch to Communion with them. But this we ſhall fall in with anon, in the mean time I main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that the clear ſenſe of that place is, that we ought not to have a Communion at the Lords Supper with ſcandalous ſinners.</p>
               <p>But I ſhall come to a ſecond Argument.

               <p>The minor will be eaſily granted. The major I ground on 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11.</p>
               <p>All that can be ſaid in the caſe, is, that the eating there forbidden, <hi>is not eating the Lords Supper.</hi> So ſaith <hi>Thomas Eraſtus,</hi>

               <p n="1">1. That it can never be proved, that it is not meant of Sacramentall eating, but of civil eating.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That there are grounds for the contrary opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That admitting it, yet the Argument ſtands ſtrong.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I deſire to know a reaſon why our adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries will needs reſtraine that Text to a civill Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. <hi>Eraſtus</hi> gives theſe reaſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Apoſtles precept concerning denying Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:118834:70"/>muſt not be ſo interpreted as to contradict Chriſts precept.</hi> But Chriſt commanded all to receive. <hi>Beza</hi> grants both,
<note place="margin">Beza <hi>de Preſh. &amp; excom. p.</hi> 70.</note> and anſwers that Chriſt might command his Apoſtles to doe that which conſidering the time he did not.</p>
               <p>But although I reverence <hi>Beza,</hi> yet I think he hath granted too much, and beſides that, his anſwer is not to the objection, which is founded, not on Chriſts pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, but his precept. I deny the Aſſumption there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and demand of <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> and all his followers,
<note place="margin">Eraſt. <hi>theſes. theſi.</hi> 26.27 28.</note> where Chriſt commands to give the Sacrament to all. <hi>Eraſtus</hi> tels us he hath proved it, but where, none knowes, all that I find in him looking that way, is but a negative argument. Chriſt did not forbid any, nor doe we find that he left his diſciples any ſuch order, nor ever reproved any that they did come to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; all which comes ſhort of this, that Chriſt did command the adminiſtration to all,

               <p>
                  <hi>Eraſtus</hi> hath another Argument. <hi>If the Apoſtle did here forbid theſe ſcandalous ſinners the Sacrament, he had contradicted himſelfe.—But he doth not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict himſelfe.</hi> The major lies upon the Doctor to prove.</p>

               <p>I meet with no more pretended reaſons. Mr <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fry</hi> hath magiſterially told us he is of this mind, but hath given us no reaſon; neither in his vindication, nor his rejoinder.</p>
               <p>I have done the firſt thing, ſhewing you that there
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:118834:73"/>hath not yet been made appear by any ſufficient ground that the <hi>not eating</hi> here is to be reſtraind to civill Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, if it were, it would be to no great pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, onely it would make us make uſe of this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as a <hi>radix</hi> for an undeniable Argument, whereas yet we plead for a direct literall prohibition; but of that in the third place.</p>
               <p>I come now to my ſecond taske,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> in which I ſhall do two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I ſhall ſhew you ſome grounds which may make us probably judge, that the Sacramentall eating, was the chiefe thing here intended.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Why civill Communion ſhould not bee the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thing here forbidden.</p>
               <p>As to the firſt, take theſe grounds for my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>Firſt,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> by the <hi>Feaſt</hi> before mentioned, ver. 8. he meant the Sacrament, this immediately followes: That by the <hi>Feaſt</hi> v. 8. the Sacrament is meant I ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> there is no other Ordinance wherein <hi>people are to eat one with another but this,</hi> and when the Text contradicts not other Scriptures, doubtleſſe it is not to be expounded by a figure.</p>
               <p>The buſineſſe of the Apoſtle was,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> to command the caſting out of the inceſtuous perſon out of Church Communion; in excommunication there are two parts.</p>
               <p>The firſt is poſitive, <hi>A ſolemn delivering up the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate perſon to Satan.</hi> This he commanded before ver. 3.4. The other is privative, and conſiſts in denying of the excommunicate perſon intimacy of civill Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. 2. Church Communion in ſome Ordinances; as for the firſt he had forbidden it, in theſe words <hi>keep no company with ſuch a one.</hi> As to the ſecond; he forbids here.—<hi>No nor eat with ſuch a one.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:118834:73"/>
               <p>I no where read, that the excommunicate perſon muſt not be preached to, for though he be as an Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, yet not in a worſe condition as to that ſure. I read he muſt be admoniſhed as a Brother. I read not that we may not pray with him. But we muſt have no Communion with him in ſuch Ordinances which doe belong to a man as a member of the Church. The chiefe of theſe is the Sacrament of the Supper, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle forbids to eat <hi>with him,</hi> that is, at the Lords Table, and ſo he hath given a perfect command for executing a ſentence of excommunication on him, in all its branches, which he ſums up, ver. 13. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore put away from amongſt you that wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> either Sacramentall eating is here for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, or civill eating, or both.</p>
               <p>If the firſt or the laſt, 'tis all we ask.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now prove the ſecond thing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That it it not probable that civill eating is here forbidden.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Civill Communion was twice forbidden before, under the notion of <hi>keep no company.</hi>

               <p n="2">2.

               <p>But 'tis granted that it is unlawfull for them to have civill Communion with them.</p>
               <p>This Argument hath troubled <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> and Mr <hi>Prin,</hi> and Mr <hi>Humfry</hi> to anſwer. Mr <hi>Humfry</hi> is ſorry to ſee any gravelled with ſuch a fallacy. Well if it be a fallacy, I hope we ſhall have it diſcovered.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Some tell us <hi>that there is no ſuch Argument, not to have company, and not to eat, are both the ſame, ſo here is no comparation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. To this I anſwer.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That <hi>Beza</hi> hath well obſerved, that the particle here uſed doth import ſuch an argumentation, <hi>where the leſſer being denied, the greater is much more denyed. Braſtus</hi> himſelfe is ſo ſenſible, that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> where it divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, argues two things ſpoken of ſo that he is forced to confeſſe that there are two things. 1. <hi>Intimate fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity with ſuch.</hi> 2. <hi>Eating with them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſurely the man forgot himſelfe,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vetat ergo duo primum ut non habeant arctam cum talibus conſuetudinem, deinde ut ne quidem edant cum eis.</hi> Eraſt. <hi>confir. theſium lib.</hi> 3.</note> for is it not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for us to eat with a covetous man at our own Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble think we?</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, I anſwer, this is nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, for we, ſuppoſing the Apoſtle ſpeaks of <hi>civill ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,</hi> raiſe our argument by conſequence from that Scripture foundation.</p>
               <p>Secondly therefore the moſt intelligent ſay, that the Argument is falſly drawn to conclude the prohibition of the greater from the leſſe:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and to this purpoſe <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſtus</hi> gives us ſome rules, and Mr <hi>Prin,</hi> and Mr <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fry</hi> ſome, to regulate theſe <hi>argumentations.</hi> Their rules are theſe. (I will examine the truth of them as I goe

               <p n="1">1. Eraſtus ſaith <hi>it may be true in gifts,</hi>

               <p>Mr <hi>Rutherford</hi> tels him, it is true enough for us, if it be true in gifts, for fellowſhip with the Saints is a guift and priviledge, and ſurely if one may have not the leſſer priviledge, he may not have the greater.

               <p>Secondly ſaith <hi>Eraſtus,</hi>

               <p>Thirdly, ſaith <hi>Eraſtus,</hi>

               <p>But firſt, <hi>Eraſtus</hi> ſhould have done well to have told us firſt, where we are commanded to eat with ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous

                  </note> Mr <hi>Prin</hi> adds another caſe, wherein he thinks this Argument not concluding, in caſe the two things compared, fall <hi>not under the ſame precept,</hi> which is the caſe here. But Mr <hi>Gilleſpy</hi> rightly tels him, this is new Logick; for not to reproach Gods name, is forbidden in the third precept; not to reproach man under the ſixth and ninth.

But let us before we grant this, examine who thoſe <hi>All</hi> were. The twelve ſaith (Mr <hi>Humfry</hi>) (we will examine that more ſtrictly anon.) By <hi>all</hi> there, out of all queſtion are meant no more then <hi>all</hi> preſent, and theſe were no more then the twelve, (if <hi>all</hi> of them) which wants proofe too. But ſuppoſe all the twelve were there, yet not one of them was diſcovered to be a ſcandalous ſinner, but even <hi>Iudas</hi> himſelfe was both in the Diſciples eyes, and in Chriſts eyes, (acting not as an omniſcient God, but as a Miniſter of the Goſpell) a viſible Saint. Which
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:118834:76"/>was the anſwer as I remember of <hi>Bonaventure,</hi> I am ſure of <hi>Halenſis</hi> and <hi>Salmeron,</hi> long ſince, and is the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall anſwer of our Divines to that cavill. Nor hath Mr <hi>Humfry</hi> in his <hi>Rejoinder,</hi> ſaid any thing to prove <hi>Iudas</hi> then ſcandalous, for though (as <hi>Eraſtus</hi> noted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him) he had then treaſon in his heart, and ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that to be true, which <hi>Eraſtus</hi> and Mr <hi>Humfry</hi> ſo much plead, (but I ſearce beleeve) that he had before covenanted with the High Prieſts, yet all this was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, and he was not diſcovered, till upon Chriſt gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him the ſop, he asking, <hi>is it I?</hi> Chriſt ſaid, <hi>thou ſaieſt it;</hi> and that reply of Chriſt was before as ſome think. <hi>Grotius</hi> well obſerves, that Chriſt did but whiſper it to him, for it is plaine, from <hi>Iohn</hi> 13. that the Diſciples knew it not till then, and he then having received the ſop, went out <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> (ſaith <hi>Iohn</hi>) which by the way, as I ſhall prove more anon) was both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the eating of the Paſchall Lambe, and before the inſtitution of the Lords Supper too.</p>
               <p>It is worth our obſerving, that Chriſt did not ſo much as call up thoſe of the ſame houſe, which it is more then probable, that he would have done, if he had intended it for a converting Ordinance, or for all promiſcuouſly. Nay ſurely Chriſt had more diſciples then the twelve, but the twelve onely (if all of them) were preſent.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Some think that they have a precept for promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous adminiſtring this Ordinance, from <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19, 20. where we have our commiſſion in theſe words; <hi>Goe teach all Nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, the Senne and the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. To that I anſwer.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is nothing expreſt concerning the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Lords Supper, and our oppoſites who are ſo nimble at every turn to call for <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſhould remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that by it they oblige themſelves to doe the like.</p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:118834:77" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>But ſecondly, admit that there is an implicit pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept likewiſe for the adminiſtration of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, yet ſurely by the ſame rule that the Apoſtles (notwithſtanding that precept) did not think themſelves obliged to baptize any, but ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved, and confeſſed their ſins; we may alſo expound the included part of the precept, and muſt adminiſter this Ordinance to none but ſuch as are able to examine themſelves, and to diſcerne the Lord Body. So that this will not ſerve their turne.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> and Mr <hi>Humfry,</hi> and Mr <hi>Boatman,</hi> make a great ſtir with the wedding Supper, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. to which all were invited, &amp;c. But,</p>
               <p n="1">1. They ſhould remember that old and true rule, <hi>Theologia parabolica non eſt argumentativa.</hi> No argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can be fetcht from Parables, but from the generall ſcope of them.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>v Mr</hi> Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frie's <hi>rejoinder. p.</hi> 52.53.54.</note> Now he that runs may read, that our Saviours main ſcope in that Parable, was not to ſhew who might, or might not come to the Lords Table, but to ſhew how angry God was with the Jewes, for not comming to Chriſt, by which unbeliefe of theirs, they procured deſtruction to themſelves, and God would now call in the Heathens, and thoſe who before were not his people, to be his people, and to fill up his Feaſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If Mr <hi>Humfry</hi> or <hi>Mr Beatman</hi> thinke they may argue, from any of the foure feet of that parable, as to this cauſe, they may prove it to be their duty, not onely to ſtand in a Pulpit, and invite all the Lords Table, but to goe into high waies and hedges too, and bring in all they meet with, yea and to compell them to come in. Now it will prove too, that they ought to fetch in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans (who are chiefly meant in the latter part of the Parable) And thus they ſhall not need to want com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany at the Lords Table.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Doctor <hi>Drake</hi> anſwered Mr <hi>Humfry</hi> well I
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:118834:77"/>think, when he told him, <hi>that Chriſt is the Feaſt meant in that Parable,</hi> and although all be invited to the Feaſt <hi>[Chriſt]</hi> yet the queſtion is, <hi>whether all be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to eat of that diſh in the Feaſt,</hi> viz.

                  <hi>the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, as wel as they are invited to hear the Goſpel.</hi> Here now M. <hi>Humfry</hi> hath a mind more to ſhew his wit then <hi>his honeſty,</hi> thus he anſwers him <hi>p.</hi> 54. <hi>This is ſomething ingenuous, but whoreas he applies this, that a man may be invited to a Feaſt, yet not to the diſh in the Feaſt; it is very fine, &amp;c.</hi> then he tels us a tale of the two egs, and concludes, <hi>let us have the diſhes of the Feaſt, and what will become of Mr</hi> Drakes <hi>Feaſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How falſly hath he abuſed Dr <hi>Drake,</hi> let the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der judge; Dr <hi>Drake</hi> doth not ſay they are not invited to any diſh, but they are not invited to <hi>every diſh,</hi> and if the <hi>diſh</hi> of the Sacrament be removed, there will a Feaſt ſtill remaine. But the truth is, it was propereſt for Mr <hi>Humfry</hi> to abuſe his Adverſary, when he could not anſwer him. If this, and other paſsages of the ſame nature in that unworthy book, be not enough to make it ſtink in the noſtrils of conſcientious Chriſtians, let them but read his language, <hi>p.</hi> 269. and the application of Scripture, to ſerve his naſtie intentions, and they may help a little towards it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I never heard of any more Scripture precepts pretended, onely that, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.24. where I deſire the Reader to conſider.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Apoſtle doth but repeat the words of our Saviour, which were ſpoke to none but viſible Saints.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Apoſtle delivers the ſame words to them, he bids them, <hi>Doe that, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which (by the way) is not a command to their Paſtors to adminiſter it, but to the Church to receive the Sacrament, and ſurely doth not concerne thoſe who in that Chapter are commanded to <hi>examine
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:118834:78"/>themſelves,</hi> &amp;c. and are not able to doe it.</p>
               <p>The queſtion is, whether the Apoſtle v. 24. doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them to receive the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, who could not examine themſelves according his rule v. 28. nor <hi>diſcern</hi> the Lords body; or who if they did partake muſt neceſsarily eat and drink their owne damnation, and make themſelves guilty of the body and blood of Chriſt: Surely this was very abſurd to ſay; If not this precept is nothing to the purpoſe, ſounding no more then this; you that are fit <hi>to doe this, doe this.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We are now come to examine if they have any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples. I never heard but of three pretended, indeed they are great ones, and enough, if they be made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare for their purpoſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The firſt, that of Chriſt, who admitted Iudas as ſome think.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond Mr <hi>Humfry</hi> mentions. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.41.42.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The third is of the Church of Corinth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will ſpeak of the latter two firſt.</p>
               <p>The firſt then is <hi>Acts</hi> 2.41, 42. in the 41 verſe, 3000 ſoules were added to the Church; verſe 42. it is ſaid <hi>they continued ſtedfaſtly in the Apostles Doctrine and fellowſhip, and breaking of bread, and prayers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I anſwer.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I ſhould put our oppoſites hand to it, to prove that the breaking of bread here ſpoke of, was the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall action. I could tell them of many who are of another mind. A phraſe like this <hi>Luke</hi> 24.30. <hi>he took bread and bleſſed, and brake it,</hi> &amp;c. is uſed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs common eating at our own Tables.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But I confeſs, I encline to to think it was Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall breaking of bread, and ſo the Syriack verſion reads it. So the phraſe is uſed. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16. But who were thoſe that brake berad together? ſuch as verſe 37.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:118834:78"/>were prickt at the heart, and had cryed out,

Whats this to prove that all ignorant ſcandalous ſinners, of but baptized, and not excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, ought to be admitted to the Lords Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble?</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the next place, the example of the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> is produced, where we are told, there were ſome <hi>came drunk to the Sacrament,</hi> or were <hi>drunk at the Sacrament; Fornicators, Covetous, Extortioners, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolaters,</hi> yet all were admitted.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I have before ſhewed, that there is no colour to ſay that any drunkards were in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> ſuch at leaſt as came drunk to the Table, and if they were ſo <hi>there,</hi> it muſt be proved that they did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and yet came againe the next time, or elſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is ſaid,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rejoinder p.</hi> 48.</note> but inſtead of this it cannot be proved (as I have ſhewn) they were drunk there, and Mr <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fry</hi> doth not diſapprove it.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The Apoſtle plainly ſaith, that ſome of this Church were <hi>Foruicators, I dolaters, Adulterers,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.9, 10, 11.</note>

               <p n="3">3. There was an <hi>inceſtuous perſon,</hi> but they are bid to purge him out, <hi>not to eat,</hi> not to keep company with him: how this proves he was admitted, I cannot tell.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Suppoſing ſuch were admitted, the Argument comes to nothing, for though the Apoſtles example binds us, yet every Churches example doth not in all things, eſpecially when the Apoſtle writes to them, and tels them, they could not <hi>partake of the cup of the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:118834:79"/>Lord, and of the cup of Devils.</hi> If they did admit Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards,

               <p>Dr <hi>Drake</hi> alſo hath another Argument, (which Mr <hi>Gilleſpy</hi> alſo hints) becauſe <hi>Chriſt promiſed to drinke new wine in his Fathers Kingdome, with thoſe who recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>There is thus much ſpoken, all which poſſibly will not compell, but ſurely in good natured people it will

               <p>Let us now heare what is pleaded on the Traitours ſide.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.20. <hi>It is ſaid he ſate down with the twelve, Mar.</hi> 14.17. <hi>He came with the twelve, Luke</hi> 22.14. <hi>He ſate down, and the twelve Apoſtles with him. Here's three Evangeliſts aſſerting it they cry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what doe they aſſert? that at their firſt ſitting downe the twelve were all there, who denies it? the queſtion is not whether they ſate downe together, but whether they roſe up together, whether they are the Sacrament together? <hi>Iohn</hi> telling us that <hi>Judas</hi> went out aſſoone as he had eaten the ſop, <hi>John</hi> 13.30.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Luke</hi> tels us, <hi>that after the inſtitution of the Supper, Chriſt ſaid, behold, the hand of him that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayeth me, is with me on the Table, and</hi> Lukes <hi>Goſpell is true.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>That thoſe words of Saint <hi>Luke</hi> ſhould have been placed before, is plaine.</p>
               <p n="1">1. From <hi>St Luke</hi> himſelfe, for their hands were now all off the Table the Supper done, and the laſt cup drunke; beſides he adds ver. 23. that the <hi>Diſciples all wondred who ſhould doe the thing;</hi> now ſurely they

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Nor is it as Mr <hi>Humfry</hi> would inſinuate, a taking a piece of one ſtory, and joining it to another, which would make it falſe, but onely a miſplacing of a piece of the ſame ſtory, which is no unuſuall thing amongſt the Evangeliſts.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Nor will it amount to ſo much, as an invalidating the truth of <hi>Lukes</hi> Goſpell, (which we deſire to be as tender of as Mr <hi>Humfry</hi>) any more then the order he pleades for, would invalidate the truth of the other three. <hi>Lukes</hi> being dictated by an infallible ſpirit, doth not oblige us to beleeve every punctilio of order, to have been as he deſcribes it, contrary to the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the other three.—Beſides, <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith plainly he went out.</p>
               <p>But he tels us, <hi>we are miſtaken in Iohn</hi> 13. <hi>for that was a Supper</hi> (I know not when nor where) <hi>two dayes before the Paſſcover, and for this he cites a marginall quotation in our Bibles, pointing him to Mat.</hi> 26.2. <hi>which he bids us look.</hi>

               <p n="1">1.

               <p>Towards the firſt, I ſhall offer theſe following con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is cleer from Scripture, that the time God ſet for the celebration of the Paſſeover, was the 14 day of the firſt month at even. <hi>Ex.</hi> 12.18, 19. <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. v. 6. <hi>Num.</hi> 28.16, 17.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is as cleer, that it was to be 7 dayes, in all which time they were to eat no unleavened bread.</p>
               <p n="3">3.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dr</hi> Lightfoots <hi>Temple ſervice. cap.</hi> 12.4.</note> The Lambe (at leaſt for the firſt Paſsover) was taken up the tenth day, whether this held or no, is doubted, and by many denyed, it was at firſt, <hi>Ex.</hi> 12.7.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is cleare, that the Jewes reckoned the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of their day, from the ſetting of the Sunne the night before.</p>
               <p n="5">5. When the daies of unleavened bread ſhould have begun, it is cleer. <hi>Lev.</hi> 23.6. on the fifteenth day, they were to eat unleavened bread, that is, from the evening ſucceeding Sun-ſet the fourteenth day. Therefore <hi>Ex.</hi> 12.18, 19. it is ſaid on the fourteenth at evening you ſhall eat unleavened bread, which fourteenth at eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, was the beginning of the fifteenth, and that is clear, for they were to end the 21 at even, and to hold but ſeven daies.
<note place="margin">Grotius <hi>in</hi> Mar. 6. <hi>Dr</hi> Willet <hi>in Ex.</hi> 12.9, 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Grotius</hi> ſaies there were eight daies of unleavened bread. So <hi>Ioſephus</hi> tels him. But Dr <hi>Willet</hi> tels us, <hi>Ioſephus</hi> muſt not be credited in it, it being expreſly againſt Scripture. <hi>Rupertus</hi> is in the ſame error, but we muſt not yield it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Yet becauſe on the fourteenth day they kill'd the Paſſcover, and at even began the firſt of unleave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned bread, it is plaine they called the fourteenth day <hi>the firſt of unleavened bread,</hi>

                  <hi>Luke,</hi> when the Paſsover ought to be killed. So that in ſtrict account, the dayes of unleavened bread began not till the Sun-ſet of the fourteenth day, yet in vulgar reckoning they began before, and the whole fourteenth day was ſo called.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And I conceive for another reaſon,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>ibid.</hi> Bux<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Hence I conceive the whole ſpace of time from the thirteenth at Sun-ſet, till the fourteenth at Sun-ſet, was called the firſt of unleaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed bread, not that it was ſtrictly ſo, but that it was called ſo from this faſhion. And in this,

                  <hi>Grotius</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees with me, though not upon this reaſon. It is plain both by <hi>Mark</hi> and <hi>Luke,</hi> that the fourteenth day is called the firſt of unleavened bread, which fourteenth began at Sunſet the thirteenth day.</p>
               <p n="8">8. For the time in which Chriſt celebrated the Paſsover, and inſtituted his Supper, it is plaine from the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23. it was <hi>the ſame night in which he was betrayed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the day wherein he was crucified;

                  <hi>Beda</hi> tels us, that no Chriſtian muſt doubt but it was the fifteenth day of the month; Dr <hi>Willet</hi> ſaith it is the received opinion. But Learned <hi>Scaliger</hi> with others, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the contrary. It is certaine, that the day whereon he was Crucified, was the day, or day before the preparation to the Jewiſh Paſsover and Sabbath. <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.42. <hi>Luke</hi> 23.54. <hi>Iohn</hi> 19.14, 42.</p>
               <p n="9">9.
<note place="margin">Scali. <hi>de emend. temp. l.</hi> 6. <hi>p.</hi> 566.</note> That he was Crucified before the noon of the day, is cleare, from <hi>Mar.</hi> 15.25. it was about the third houre. And <hi>Mat,</hi> 26.45, 46. after he had been ſome
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:118834:84"/>time on the Croſs, was the ſixth houre when the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs began. Now the Jewes reckoning their houres, from our ſix to ſix, the third houre was nine of the clock, at which time ſaith <hi>Mark,</hi> he was Crucified, and the ſixth houre was twelve of the clock, at which time the darkneſs began, and laſted till three.</p>
               <p n="10">10. For the better finding out therefore of the night wherein he was betrayed, (in which he inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Supper (ſaith St <hi>Paul</hi>) Let us conſider what the Goſpell ſaies was done, from the time of the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Supper till his death.</p>
               <p>Some think that excellent Sermon <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.15, 16. was preach'd in the chamber where he adminiſtred the Supper. Some think it was, as he was going to the Mount of Olives and Gethſemane. Certaine it is, it was after the Supper. On the mount of Olives he <hi>ſings an hymne;</hi> after this he goeth to Gethſemane, and is in an agony, <hi>prayeth thrice</hi> (beſides that prayer <hi>John</hi> 17.) After this,
<note place="margin">Mat. 27.1, 2. Mar. 15.1, 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Judas</hi> comes and apprehends him, he is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried before <hi>Caiphas</hi> the High Prieſt, there he is kept in examination till the morning, then the Prieſts conſult what to doe with him, they reſolve to ſend him to <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,</hi> there he is largely examin'd. <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. ver. 11. to ver. 27. <hi>Pilate</hi> reſolves to fend him to <hi>Herod</hi> the King, he is examin'd before him, mockt, crown'd with thornes, &amp;c. Then he is ſent back againe to <hi>Pilate; Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi> examines him againe, ſcourgeth him, and delivers him to be Crucified. Two things obſerve, or three. 1. It was the morning before he was ſent to <hi>Pilate</hi> at all. 2. It is ſaid <hi>Pilate</hi> ſate in Judgement on him at the ſixth hour. <hi>Iohn</hi> 19.14. which was twelve of the clock. 3. he was examined in two ſeverall Courts, and twice in one of them.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Which (to ſpeak the leaſt) makes it ſeem probable to me, that the night wherein Chriſt was betraied (which was the night wherein he inſtituted the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per)
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:118834:84"/>was not the immediate night before he died, for then you can allow him for his two tryals before <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi> and <hi>Herod,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mar. 15.25.</note> but from the morning till nine of the clock, at nine ſaith <hi>Mark</hi> he was Crucified. It was the morning ſaith <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Marke,</hi> before they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him to <hi>Pilate.</hi> Nay more, <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaies,
<note place="margin">Iohn 19.14.</note> that at the ſixth houre <hi>Pilate</hi> fate in judgement on him, which could not be if he were Crucified the ſame day, for ſaith <hi>Marke</hi> at the third houre he was Crucified.

               </p>
               <p n="12">12. I know learned <hi>Gerard</hi> indeavours to untie this knot, and to that purpoſe tels us, that as the Jewes divided their night into foure watches, each conſiſting of three houres, ſo they divided their day into foure quarters; The firſt from ſix a clock, which was their firſt houre, to nine, which was their third houre; The ſecond from nine their third houre, to twelve their ſixth houre; The third from twelve their ſixth houre, to three their ninth houre; The fourth from three their ninth houre, to ſix their twelfth houre; and he ſaies, that when it is ſaid <hi>Pilate</hi> ſate in judgement at the ſixth houre, <hi>Iohn</hi> 19.14. it muſt be meant not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely at twelve of the clock, but at ſome time between nine and twelve. And when <hi>Marke</hi> ſaith he was Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified at the third houre, it muſt be meant the third part of the day between twelve and three of the clock. But beſides that, this is not warranted from Scripture. I doe no where find, that they call'd their third quarter of the day, the third houre.

Now ſurely the third houre in <hi>Mark</hi> is the ſame with the third houre. <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.3. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.15.</p>
               <p>But if wee may allow that he ſuffered the ſecond day after his apprehenſion, we can put a faire inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, both upon <hi>Iohn</hi> 9.14. ſaying Chriſt was tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before <hi>Pilate,</hi> about noon the day after his appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, and the next day was crucified about nine of the clock the third houre, (as Saint <hi>Mark</hi> calleth it) and about twelve of the clocke the ſame day the <hi>prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-naturall</hi> Eclypſe began, and laſted till three, about which time he died.</p>
               <p n="13">13. This I am induced to beleeve, conſidering that the Jewiſh morning began at ſix of the clock,
<note place="margin">Mat. 27.1, 2. Mar. 15.1, 2.</note> at which time ſaith <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Marke,</hi> the <hi>High Prieſt and Elders met to take counſell to put him to death, and agreed to carry him to</hi> Pilate, who was the Romiſh Governour, and we can hardly imagine him to be upon a Judgement Seat before eight or nine of the clock, and though the Jewes were haſty to put him to death, yet no ſuch thing appeares in <hi>Pilate,</hi> he was loth to doe it,
<note place="margin">Mat. 27.19.</note> as appeares by the ſtory, and ſpent ſome time in examining witneſſes, was a little hindred by his wife,
<note place="margin">Lu. 23.9, 10, 11.</note> then ſent him to <hi>Herod,</hi> who being ſo great a man probably did not preſently heare him; when he did, we muſt allow him ſome time. After this he was
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:118834:85"/>ſent to <hi>Pilate</hi> againe, who ſate in Judgement upon him at twelve of the clock, <hi>Iohn</hi> 19.14.</p>
               <p n="14">14. If this be true, the night wherein he admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred the Supper, muſt be two nights before his paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It is plaine, he ſuffered the day before the Jewiſh Paſſeover, as I ſaid before, not on that day (as ſome fondly thinke) for beſides that,
<note place="margin">Scali. <hi>de emend. temp. l.</hi> 6.</note> the Paſsover was that yeare on the Sabbath. <hi>Scaliger</hi> well obſerves, that it was too high a Feſtivall for the Jewes to doe any ſuch worke in.</p>
               <p n="15">15. That the Jewiſh paſsover was to begin on the evening after the Sun-ſet of the fourteenth day, is plain from Scripture. <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. So then Chriſt ſhould have ſuffered on the fourteenth day of the month, which was their <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, the day of their preparation; and in vulgar account, the firſt day of unleavened bread, as I ſaid before.</p>
               <p n="16">16. But it is plaine Chriſt did not ſuffer on that day, for all three Evangeliſts agree, that this day his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples came to him ſaying,

                  </note> tels us, that by an Ancient tradition of the Rabbies, which <hi>Sebaſtian Murſter</hi> ſaith, was a Law made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the a Temple, by the Jewiſh <hi>Sanhedrim;</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to <hi>Rabbi Eliezer.</hi> The Jewes in caſe the Paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over day fell out any yeare on the eve of the Sabbath, put off the Paſsover and kept them both together. This <hi>Beza</hi> approves of, though it diſtaſts <hi>Grotius;</hi> and I find <hi>Bucer</hi> thus untying this knot. So then according to this rule, the day of the <hi>Paſſeover</hi> ſo falling out this yeare, they began their Paſsover the ſixteenth at even, and kill'd their Lambe the fifteenth; ſo that this yeare
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:118834:86"/>ſtrictly the fifteenth day was the day of their prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in which Chriſt dyed.</p>
               <p n="18">18. I referre it to the Learned to enquire, whether when theſe caſes hapned, that the Paſſeover was kept the ſixteenth day, (being their Sabbath) they began to ſearch for leaven the fourteenth day at Sun-ſet? or whether in this caſe they did not keep two dayes of preparation, and began their ſearch for leaven at their uſuall time, onely putting off the Paſchall Supper; if they did, which I am apt to beleeve, then the firſt of their dayes of unleavened bread, according to vulgar account, began as uſually the beginning of the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth day, <hi>viz.</hi> immediately after Sun-ſet on the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth, and was two juſt dayes before the Paſſeover, (as that yeare fell) though in ordinary yeares but one day: this I confeſſe to me ſeems very probable.</p>
               <p n="19">19. Or elſe the Evangeliſts muſt be underſtood thus. The Diſciples came to him the firſt day of unleavened bread, that is, that day on which the Paſſeover ought to be killed, according to Gods Law, in the evening precedent that day, which in ordinary yeares was call'd <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and the day preceding the Paſſeover (though it were otherwiſe that yeare.</p>
               <p n="20">20. It is certaine that in a ſtrict ſence, it cannot be true that his Diſciples came to him that day, on which the Paſſeover was killed that yeare, for then he muſt either be Crucified the firſt day of the Feaſt of the Paſſeover, or after; and then that night in which they ſhould have are the Paſſeover, the High Prieſts were conſulting to murder him, or elſe the Scripture muſt be denyed, which ſaies, he died before the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over.</p>
               <p n="21">21. Chriſt doubtleſſe died on the fifteenth day, (let <hi>Scaliger</hi> ſay what he pleaſe) which 15 day ſhould have been according to Gods Law, the firſt of the Paſſeover; but was not that yeare, becauſe of their tradition. Our
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:118834:86"/>Paſſeover was thus on the true Paſſeover day offered; this fifteenth day they that yeare kill'd their Paſſeover; and I am apt to beleeve that the Evangeliſts ſpeak of that day,
<note place="margin">Mar. 14.12. Luke 22.7.</note> not wherein the Paſſeover was killed that yeare, but wherein it ought to have been killed. Therefore <hi>Luke</hi> cals it the day <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="22">22. Yet here <hi>Grotius and Piſcators</hi>

                  </gap> muſt helpe us; for if he eate the Paſſeover the fourteenth at even, that is, the evening after Sun-ſet, how could his diſciples come to him the fourteenth day, to know where they ſhould provide. <hi>Piſcator</hi> ſaith,
<note place="margin">Piſcator <hi>ad. loc.</hi>
                  </note> we muſt underſtand it of the day before, in the afternoon of the thirteenth day, when the fourteenth day, which was the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> was juſt at hand, then the Diſciples came to him, and ſaid, <hi>Where wilt thou that we prepare the Paſſeover, &amp;c.</hi> And that night which was the even of the fourteenth day he came and did eate it, which was two full daies before the Jewiſh Paſſeover that yeare, and the time when in former yeares they began to ſearch for Leaven.</p>
               <p n="23">23. So we ſay, that Chriſt did that yeare antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate the time of the Paſſeover, both the Jewiſh time that yeare, which according to their tradition, was two dayes after,
<note place="margin">Scali. <hi>de emend. temp. l.</hi> 6. Grotius <hi>in</hi> Mat. 6. Piſ. in Mat. 26.</note> and the true time which was the night after. <hi>Scaliger</hi> and <hi>Grotius,</hi> and others, grant, he anticipated the Paſſeover. <hi>Piſcator</hi> grants, that he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipated the Jewiſh day that yeare. I beleeve he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipated it two dayes, that ſo he might die that very day, which according to Gods Law, was to be the firſt of the Paſſeover, and ſo ſhew himſelfe the true Paſſeover. <hi>Grotius</hi> gives us a good hint, that Chriſt gives a reaſon why he antedated the time of the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.18. bidding his Diſciples tell the Maſter of the houſe, <hi>my time is at hand,</hi> I will keep the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over;
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:118834:87"/>that is, <hi>I know I ſhall be apprehended this night, and ſhall not be in a capacity to keep the Paſſeover at the due time, therefore I will keep it this night;</hi> which was after Sun-ſet the thirteenth day, in the beginning of the fourteenth, and then he dyed the fifteenth, which was as I ſaid, uſually their firſt great day, but this yeare, the preparation to the firſt day of the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over.</p>
               <p n="24">24. I am far from thinking, that this notion of mine is liable to no exceptions, but I deſire thoſe who ſhall except, to think of a better way to reconcile thoſe Texts, which plainly prove that he died upon one of <hi>their preparation daies. Mat.</hi> 27.62. <hi>Mar.</hi> 15.42. <hi>Luke</hi> 23.54. <hi>Iohn</hi> 19.42. with thoſe Texts, which ſay, his Diſciples came to him, ſaying, <hi>Where ſhall we prepare the Paſſeover, on the firſt day of unleavened Bread.</hi> whether in regard of their double Feaſt, they might not have that yeare a double preparation day? I refer to be enquired. I am apt to beleeve, that both the fourteenth and fifteenth dayes were both daies of preparation, that yeare, becauſe of <hi>Iohn</hi> 18.28. <hi>Iohn</hi> 19.14. compared with <hi>Iohn</hi> 19.31, 42.</p>
               <p>My opinion is, that on the thirteenth day of the month <hi>Niſan</hi> in the afternoon, two full daies before the Jewiſh Paſſeover that yeare began, the Prieſts met to conſult how to take Chriſt, and put him to death, of which we read <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.3. <hi>Mar.</hi> 14 1. <hi>Luke</hi> 22.2. and that toward Sunſet that night the Diſciples came to Chriſt, ſaying, <hi>Where wilt thou that we prepare the Paſſeover.</hi> Chriſt directs them; and that night which was the even of the fourteenth day he came with twelve, amongſt whom was <hi>Judas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus much for the time, now let us conſider the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the whole action, which is fully deſcribed by no Evangeliſts ſingly, but by comparing them one with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</p>

               <list>

               <p n="6">6. The Table being thus furniſhed, and one cup of Wine drank, <hi>Buxtorfius</hi> and the Dr agree, that the next thing the officiator did, was, he took ſome of the bitter herbes in the third diſh, and dipt them in the thick ſauce in the fourteenth diſh, and eates himſelfe, and gives to the reſt immediately, ſaith the Doctor. The diſhes are taken off, and they tell one another, and tell their children of the bitter affliction they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in <hi>Egypt,</hi> &amp;c. when this is done.</p>

               <p n="7">7. The diſhes are brought on againe, and the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciator takes the unleavened bread, and the bitter herbes, and the Paſchall Lambe, and conſecrates them all ſeverally, uſing certaine forms of words in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration, and washeth his hands againe, and uſeth a ſhort prayer; then they drink a ſecond cup of Wine.</p>
               <p n="8">8.

When he hath thus diſpoſed of the one piece, he takes the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and gives it to the company, who eat it.</p>
               <p n="9">9. After this ſaith Dr <hi>Lightfoot,</hi> they give thanks, and eat their fleſh-meat of the Paſchall Lambe, to the quantity of an Olive; yet becauſe this eating ſhould be to ſatetie, he ſaies they uſually eate ſomething be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, then they waſh their hands againe, and ſay grace over a third cup of Wine, (ſaith the Doctor) and then drink it off; this ſaith he they uſually call the <hi>cup of bleſſing,</hi> in alluſion to which, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> cals the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall cup ſo.
<note place="margin">Luke 22.17.</note> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16. And this (ſaith he) is the firſt cup ſpoken of by <hi>Luke.</hi>

With this likewiſe the Doctor agrees, telling us this was the bread which Chriſt took after the third cup, and bleſſed &amp; <hi>brake it,</hi> and give it to them, ſaying, <hi>Take eat, this is my body,</hi> &amp;c</p>
               <p n="11">11. Laſtly, both the Dr and <hi>Buxtorf.</hi> agree, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

               <p>This was the Jewiſh order at their private Paſſeovers, now let us ſee how Chriſt ſutes this in his celebration.</p>
               <p>I hope any ingenious Reader will grant me, that Chriſt was not tied preciſely to any piece of this, that had no baſis, but tradition. This ſuppoſed, I ſay that the Jewiſh Paſſeover being that year on the ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth day, or the fifteenth at even, (which is all one) becauſe of the Sabbath, two full daies before this, <hi>viz.</hi> The thirteenth in the afternoon,
<note place="margin">Mat. 27.1, 2. Mar. 14.1, 2.</note> the High Prieſts took counſell how to kill our Saviour; <hi>Iudas</hi> had not then bargain'd with them, for then that counſell had been needleſſe. That very afternoon neare Sun-ſet, (at which time began the firſt of unleavened bread, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary yeares according to vulgar account) Chriſt ſends his Diſciples to prepare the Paſſeover, and when it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be dark, he and the twelve, came and found all prepar'd for them. There's the firſt thing.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. He came in the evening with the twelve.</item>
                  <item>2. They all ſate downe. So ſay all the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Now Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> goes on, <hi>Iohn</hi> 13.2. <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Supper begin ended; ſo we tranſlate it. So <hi>Tremellius</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tremel. <hi>Bib.</hi> Beza <hi>verſ. Teſt. Tig. Verſio.</hi> Piſc. <hi>in. loc.</hi> Eraſm. <hi>Verſio.</hi> Gerard <hi>Harm. cap.</hi> 170.</note> but the <hi>Tigurine Verſion</hi> and <hi>Piſcator</hi> tranſlate it better; <hi>Coena facta, Quum Coena fieret;</hi> while they were at Supper, which indeed the phraſe properly ſignifies: and <hi>Gerard</hi> quotes the like in the Septuagint. <hi>Eraſmus</hi> agrees with the <hi>Tigurine Verſion,</hi> while they were ſet at this Paſchall Supper, the Devill put thoughts into <hi>Iudas</hi> to betray his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. Verſe 4. Chriſt <hi>riſeth from Supper,</hi> (it was not
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:118834:91"/>ended then) and laieth aſide his garments, and <hi>takes a Towel and waſheth his Diſciples feet.</hi> This action of Chriſts, troubles Expoſitors, ſome would have it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Supper, (expreſlely contrary to Scripture) ſome after the <hi>Paſchall Supper,</hi> ſome after all. But let who will ſay it, they ſhall never be able to prove, that it was an ordinary uſage amongſt the Jewes, either in ſupper time, or after ſupper, for the Mr. to riſe, and waſh his gueſts feet, much leſſe at the Paſſeover. Though waſhing of feet were uſuall amongſt them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſate downe, when they came newly into the houſe, and waſhing of hands uſuall at the Paſſcover, as I ſaid before.</p>
               <p>This action of Chriſts therefore, was queſtionleſſe extraordinary, to teach his Diſciples thoſe two great leſſons of <hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>Charity.</hi> I am apt to beleeve that whereas the Jewes at their Paſſeover, when they were ſate, and had drank their firſt cup of Wine, waſht their hands. So when they came to this action, (to which Chriſt was not tied, being no piece of the Law) he roſe up and waſht all their feet, and this was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the fourth action in the Paſſeover, before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the Jewiſh order; for the third, the drinking the firſt cup of wine, whether they did it or no, is not much materiall, if they did, no Evangeliſt ſpeakes of it.</p>
               <p>According to the Jewiſh order in the next place, the table was furniſhed, during the time of Chriſts wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing their feet, and their ſetting diſhes on the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, we may conceive all that ſpirituall diſcourſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed betwixt Chriſt and his Diſciples; which you have, <hi>Iohn</hi> 13.6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 verſes. Whether <hi>Iudas</hi> his feet were waſh'd or no, is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt. Surely he was there.</p>
               <p>Though the Author of that piece,
<note place="margin">Cypr. <hi>op. l. de ablutione pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum ſub initio.</hi>
                  </note> in <hi>Cyprian's</hi> works <hi>de ablutione pedum</hi> denies it, yet I can ſee no ground for it.</p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:118834:91"/>
               <p>The Table being thus furniſhed; the next thing we obſerved in the Jewiſh order, was the Offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ators taking ſome of the Sallet, and ſopping it, and giving to the reſt. This you have excellently deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by St <hi>John,</hi> chap. 13.18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26. With which agrees, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. v. 21, 22, 23, 24, 25. <hi>Mar.</hi> 14. v. 18, 19, 20, 21. <hi>Luke</hi> 22. v. 21, 22, 23.

Then the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples were troubled looking one upon another; <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> beckens to <hi>John,</hi> who leaned neareſt Chriſts breaſt, to ask him who it was, he askes, Chriſt would give no other anſwer, but <hi>it is he to whom I ſhall give the ſop when I have dipped it;</hi> upon this he dips it, and gives it to <hi>Judas;</hi> upon this, <hi>Jud is</hi> askes, <hi>Is it I Maſter, Mat.</hi> 26. <hi>he ſaies, thou ſaiſt it, John</hi> 13.27. Satan preſently enters into him. Chriſt bids him, <hi>what he did doe quickly,</hi> none knew wherefore he ſaid it, ſaith <hi>John,</hi> which makes <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> think, he whiſpered <hi>Judas</hi> when he ſaid, Thou ſaieſt it, <hi>John</hi> 13.30. <hi>Judas</hi> having received the ſop, <hi>went out immediately,</hi> hitherto, this Paſchall ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty were onely, 1, Met at night. 2. Sate downe. 3. Poſſibly the firſt cup of Wine was drank off. (if they drank it all) 4. In ſtead of waſhing their hands the Lord had waſht their feet. 5. The Table was fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. 6. The Herbes ſopt in the ſowre ſauce were given.—Now is <hi>Judas</hi> gone out; ſuppoſe about ſeven or eight of the clock at night, the ſame night which followed the afternoon, in which the Elders and Prieſts had been conſulting to murther Chriſt; nor doe I beleeve that till now, <hi>Iudas</hi> had compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with them; for it was at ſupper the Devill put theſe thoughts firſt into <hi>Iudas</hi> heart. <hi>Iohn</hi> 13.2. and <hi>Luke</hi> 22.3. <hi>Iudas</hi> his going to the High Prieſts, is

I know in the other three Evangeliſts, his going to them, is ſet before. But I beleeve it an hiſterology, they not ſo punctually, as <hi>Iohn,</hi> deſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But now, <hi>Iudas</hi> knew where he was, he leaves them at ſupper; the Chiefe Prieſts were in the ſame City, he goes to them, and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly makes a bargaine, and comes againe to take him.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, this Paſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hall ſociety, Chriſt and the eleven Diſciples went on with the ſupper. Their next actions, according to the Jewiſh order, was for the Officiator to break the Cake, and give a part, and reſerve a part, then to drink a ſecond cup of Wine, then to eat their Lambe: Of all this, there is nothing in the foure Evangeliſts; <hi>Iohn</hi> brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king off with the ſop, and the other ſaying onely they ſate down and did eat; Except we ſhould ſay thoſe words, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.15. were ſpoken by Chriſt, while they did eat the Lambe.—Their next worke was to drink a third cup of Wine; this in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, is that firſt cup <hi>Luke</hi> mentions, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.17. To which the Apoſtle alludes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16. Their next work was the eating of the unleavened bread, reſerv'd for the <hi>Aphicomen,</hi> the laſt bit, and their laſt, the drinking of the fourteenth cup of Wine, the latter was when the ſupper was done. Now, this bread and cup Chriſt did eat and drink and with them inſtituted his ſupper; theſe are not mentioned by <hi>Iohn,</hi> becauſe ſo ſully expreſt by <hi>Luke, Marke,</hi> and <hi>Matthew.</hi> Thus you ſee, the ſupper was but one,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:118834:92"/>and perfectly reported by <hi>Iohn,</hi> and the other Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts; <hi>Iohn</hi> reporting the firſt part, the other the ſecond; you ſee alſo how many pieces of the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh order, are evident in the celebration.</p>
               <p>Whether I have catcht the bird or no, I know not, confident I am, my Reader will judge I have been long enough beating the buſh, and if this notion prove true, it will follow.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That <hi>Iudas</hi> had not ſo much as compacted with the Chiefe Prieſts, when his hand was with Chriſt on the Table.</p>
               <p n="2">2 That he was gone before the Lord inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his ſupper; yea</p>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>That it is the duty of the Officers of a Church, to keep the fellowſhip of the Church pure.</hi> This none will deny, that is but <hi>mentis compos,</hi> if any be inclined to deny it, he ſhould doe well, firſt to think to what purpoſe the rod of diſcipline is elſe put into their hands. 2. How to expound 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7, 13. and thoſe many other Texts in Scripture, which looke this way.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That it is their eſpeciall duty, to keep the fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the Church, as to this Ordinance, pure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As this was proved before, upon the opening of the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.8. So upon the conceſſion of the former, it is no leſſe clear from reaſon. It is apparent, that of all other Ordinances, this Ordinance alone is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for ſuch as have ſomething of Grace in them. The Word is called the <hi>bread of life,</hi> and it is to bee offered to dead ſoules to quicken them. Heathens were ever admitted to heare, thoſe who are the profaneſt perſons, are the objects of Diſcipline, the excommunicate may, and ought to be admoniſhed as Brethren. I know not wherein the Officers of the Church can have a worke to keep the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Church pure, if not in this Ordinance, and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:118834:95"/>as to this, which the Scripture plainly ſaith, cannot be partaked of worthily, without <hi>examining our ſelves,</hi> and being able to <hi>diſcerne the Lords Body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the minor propoſition, <hi>That there may be ſome in the Church, not yet caſt out, with whom the fellowſhip of the Church in this Ordinance cannot be pure;</hi> I prove.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If there may be ſome in the Church, who apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are not fit ſubjects to receive this holy thing, then there may be ſome in the Church with whom the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip of the Church in this Ordinance cannot be pure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But there may be ſome in the Church, who appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently are not fit ſubjects</hi> to receive this holy thing. —<hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He that denies the major muſt maintaine, that a communion of ſuch as are appearingly fit for it, and appearingly <hi>notoriouſly unfit for it, and unable to it, is a pure communion,</hi> and by that time he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that he may have proved, that a communion made up of a Saint, a <hi>Hog, a Dog,</hi> a mad man and a foole, is yet a pure communion. Surely the appearing <hi>purity</hi> of a communion in this Ordinance, lies in the appearing capacity and worthineſſe of all to receive it.</p>
               <p>But (I ſay) <hi>there may ſome in the Church, who appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently are not fit ſubjects to receive this holy thing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This I eaſily prove. Thoſe that cannot <hi>examine themſelves, that cannot diſcerne the Lords body, or that doe partake of the cup of Devils, are apparently not fit ſubjects to receive the Lords Supper.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28, 29. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.21.</p>
               <p>But there may be ſuch in the Church.—<hi>Ergo.</hi>

Let any but conſider, that we are but Truſtees with Gods Ordinances, and not to deliver them out to any without our Maſters Order, ſuch as he gives us command to give them to, and then this will follow, according to Mr <hi>Humfrie</hi>'s Doctrine: Either,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That God hath <hi>given us order, to give them to thoſe whom he forbad, under paine of damnation to receive them;</hi> nay, <hi>who have the Markes of ſuch as cannot take them.</hi> Or ſecondly,</p>

               <p>Firſt, I know none ſaies, that the <hi>Ordinance is pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:</hi> I thinke that predicate cannot in any caſe be properly and ſtrictly predicated of a divine inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the Ordinance is holy, and though it may be abuſed and profaned, yet it is not capable of intrinſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call pollution.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is vanity to ſay, that the preſence of a ſcandalous perſon can defile a private Member, who hath diſcharged his duty towards him, and towards God. Chriſtians have incumbent upon them, 1. A duty towards God. 2. Towards their Brethren; if a Communicant hath examined and prepared himſelf, and diſcharged his duty towards ſcandalous perſons, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. telling them of it. 2. Then taking two or three with him, and admoniſhing them. 3. Then informing the Officers of the Church; I beleeve ſuch a Chriſtian may lawfully communicate with a ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous perſon, it is nothing can defile him but ſin in not doing his duty. But with Mr <hi>Humfrie</hi>'s leave, and Mr <hi>Boatmans</hi> too, that Chriſtian who knowingly partakes with ſcandalous ſinners (not having done this duty to them) is defiled, not by partaking with them, but not having done their duty to them before; where by the way we ſee what ſnares theſe Patrons of promiſcuous Communion run their godly Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants into; when it may be for one godly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they have ten ſcandalous communicate with them. How impoſſible is it they ſhould do that duty which is requiſite from them to diſcharge their owne ſoules, without the doing of which they cannot without ſin communicate with them.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Whether in no caſe it be lawfull for the Paſtor of the Church (not having a formed Presbytery,) if he knows any of his Church to be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant or ſcandalous, to deny to them the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, (though they be not excommunicated, nor juridically cenſured.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before I ſpeake to this Queſtion (that I may not be mis-interpreted) I will crave leave to premiſe ſome few things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I grant, that the moſt regular and orderly way of adminiſtring the Ordinance of the Lords Supper in Congregations, is by the <hi>triall and judging of all the members by a Presbytery,</hi> conſiſting of the Miniſter
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:118834:105"/>and Ruling Elders: I looke upon Elders as an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Jeſus Chriſt, and Officers equally betruſted with the Miniſter in all acts of juriſdiction, and to a regular and ordinary ſuſpenſion queſtionleſſe an act of Juriſdiction is required.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I plead not for the ſole <hi>power of Juriſdiction</hi> to be in the hands of a ſingle Miniſter, this were to ſet up an Epiſcopacy, yea, more than an Epiſcopacy (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt a papall power) in every Pariſh; as I thinke Ruling Elders are equally with him betruſted with the power of Juriſdiction and Government, ſo I thinke they muſt joyne with him in juridicall ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3.
<note place="margin">I ſpeak this and the ſourth as my own private judgement, and ſhall not go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to impoſe ſuch a perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion upon others, not knowing what upon fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoughts, I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>y ſelfe might judge in theſe caſes, but at preſent only thus limiting my queſtion.</note> I plead not for <hi>Miniſters power</hi> in ſuch places where are <hi>perſons fit to be choſen as Officers</hi> who ſhall refuſe the Office or people who ſhall refuſe to chooſe, I thinke in ſuch a caſe a Miniſter may lawfully forbear the adminiſtring the Ordinance, and giving Goſpell-Priviledges to thoſe who deſpiſe any Goſpell-Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, or ſhall deny any Goſpell duty; yea, I cannot tell whether a Miniſter could diſcharge a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in adminiſtring at all to ſuch a people till the Lord had changed their hearts, and convinced them of their duty, and their ſin in refuſing it, being a ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall to all well ordered Churches.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I would not plead ſtrongly for his power in this thing in a Congregation who had none fit to chooſe, but were ſcituated ſo nigh to ſome rightly organized Church that they could conveniently go and partake there; I rather thinke it the Miniſters duty in ſuch caſes to perſwade thoſe who in his Congregation are fit for the Ordinance to joyne themſelves to ſuch a Church, (as to that Ordinance) and were it my own caſe, (if I ſaw that Church walked orderly, and kept the Ordinances pure) I my ſelfe would not only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade my people ſo to joyne, but my ſelfe rather ſo
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:118834:105"/>joyne than ſet up any extraordinary courſe.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In caſe there were a formed Claſſis of Triers, either eſtabliſhed by the Civill power, or by a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary agreement of the godly Miniſters in a County, which uſed to meet ſo neare the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that the godly people could go and ſubmit to their triall, I do prefer this before a Miniſters ſingle Examination and Judgement.</p>
               <p>But in ſuch a caſe as this now <hi>Where there is in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation a godly Miniſter, and a competent number of godly people to make up a Communion at the Lords Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and theſe people are willing to do what in them lies to put themſelves in order, and to chooſe Elders, and wiſh from their ſoules that they had ſome to chooſe, but at preſent they have none, nor are like to have any ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, nor are nigh any Organized Church with which they can enjoy the Ordinance, nor any Claſſis to which they can approve themſelves: Whether now, in ſuch a caſe as this the Miniſter may not adminiſter the Ordinance, and not only admoniſh the ignorant and ſcandalous to keep away, but take account of his peoples knowledge, and take all due courſes to be informed of their lives, and if he finds any ignorant and ſcandalous, that, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding admonition, will preſume to come whither he may not; yea, whether he ought not to deny the Elements to him?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. I heartily wiſh, that either by the <hi>Civill power,</hi> or a <hi>voluntary act</hi> of the people, parochiall Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were ſo united, that in every Precinct there might be found perſons fit for Officers.</p>
               <p n="7">7. I thinke in ſuch caſes a Miniſter <hi>ſhould act with a great deale of prudence;</hi> I would in ſuch a caſe do nothing (as neare as I could) <hi>without the ſatisfaction of the Community.</hi> I meane, not being acted by their vote, but ſtating the buſineſſe to them firſt at ſome meeting, and if it were poſſible gaining their conſent and approbation.</p>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:118834:106"/>
               <p>And theſe things premiſed:</p>
               <p>I humbly conceive, <hi>that a Miniſter of the Goſpell in ſuch a cauſe, may, by vertue of his Office, (wanting a Presbytery) deny the adminiſtration of the Elements to any ſuch as he ſhall judge ignorant, and be able to prove ſo ſcandalous, as if he had a Presbytery, he might be juri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dically ſuſpended.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall humbly propoſe my grounds for my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in it (which yet is not mine alone.)</p>
               <p>In ſuch a caſe as this a Miniſter may either <hi>wholly omit the Ordinance,</hi> or elſe adminiſter it <hi>promiſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to all, be they never ſo ignorant or ſcandalous;</hi> or elſe thirdly by <hi>his own power thus deny it to ſuch as he finds ſo.</hi> But in ſuch a caſe <hi>he may not wholly omit the adminiſtration of the Ordinance, nor ſecondly admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter it promiſcuouſly.</hi>—Ergo.</p>
               <p>The disjunction cannot be denied, for there is no fourth expedient can be found but the way of our diſſenting brethren, (and but ſome of them nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) that all <hi>the members ſhould have power,</hi> which I can never yeeld to till they can tell me <hi>whoſhall be the Ruled if all be Rulers:</hi> But of my Brethren, who are of the Presbyterian perſwaſion, there are two diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent opinions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Some thinke, <hi>that in ſuch a caſe he is bound whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to omit the adminiſtration</hi> till he can have a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery. I muſt crave leave to diſſent here.</p>
               <p>And I thinke Mr <hi>Jeanes</hi> hath ſaid enough to prove that the totall omiſſion of the Ordinance in a <hi>non-presbyterated Church</hi> cannot be juſtifiable.</p>
               <p n="1">1. All Chriſts <hi>Commands are to be obſerved in a non-presbyterated Church.</hi> Do this, <hi>do it often, &amp;c.</hi> are Chriſt Commands as well as any other.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Chriſt himſelfe, and his Apoſtles,</hi> Act. 2.41. <hi>admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred it in a none-presbyterate Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Here are <hi>fit Communicants, and here is a Miniſter,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:118834:106"/>and this is an Ordinance of Chriſt</hi> for the perfecting of the Saints.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Chriſts death ought to be remembred in a non-presbyterated Church, and the Saints ſhould grow in grace there as well as elſewhere.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe, and the reſt of Mr <hi>Jeanes</hi> his Arguments, I muſt confeſſe, do much prevaile with me to make me thinke that the bare want of <hi>Ruling Elders</hi> in the Church cannot warrant a Miniſters totall neglect of the adminiſtration of this Ordinance. Beſides the ill conſequences which would doubtleſſe be of ſuch an Omiſſion. Such as 1. <hi>Peoples running to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Churches.</hi> 2. Chriſtians <hi>decay in grace, and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall weakneſſes</hi> for want of that great Ordinance for ſtrength and quickning. 3. A blotting out of the memory of Chriſts death, or at leaſt of that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance out of Chriſtians minds; theſe things make me conclude it ſinfull for a godly Miniſter, who hath people fit for a Communion, wholly to omit the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance. So that a Miniſter cannot be bound to that.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Nor ean a Miniſter be bound to adminiſter to thoſe whom he knows to be ignorant and ſcandalous.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This moſt of my former Arguments prove.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He cannot be <hi>bound to give holy things to dogs, and caſt pearls before ſwine,</hi> directly contrary to that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He cannot be bound to give it to thoſe, <hi>whom he knows cannot drinke the Lords Cup, for then there would lye an Obligation upon him to profane the Lords Ordinances.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>He cannot be bound to give it to thoſe with whom it is unlawfull for him to keep that feaſt, or to eate,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.8, 11.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>He cannot be bound to declare thoſe one body, and make thoſe one breaſt who viſibly are not one body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>His Obligation muſt be from Scripture precepts or
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:118834:107"/>preſidents:</hi> but I have ſhewed there are none to that purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>He cannot he bound to any act by which he is guilty of making the Communion</hi> of the Church im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>There cannot lye an Obligation upon him to give the Ordinance</hi> to thoſe who viſibly appeare to be ſuch as are not bound to receive.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>He cannot be bound to give the Sacrament of the Supper to ſuch as he might not lawfully baptize,</hi> in caſe they were not yet baptized.</p>
               <p>I made good theſe Arguments before, and they conclude as well for <hi>miniſteriall</hi> privative ſuſpenſion as for poſitive ſuſpenſion.</p>
               <p>Theſe two parts being ſuch as he may not take,</p>
               <p n="1">1. He muſt either <hi>put the power of juriſdiction into the hand of the Community,</hi> and ſo by their major vote, ſuſpend, or admit, or</p>
               <p n="2">2. He muſt <hi>by his own power</hi> (during this ſtate of the Church) put by ſome not juridically cenſuring and ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending them, but ſuſpending his own act as to ſuch perſons.</p>
               <p>The former of theſe he may not do.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For Chriſt never committed any ſuch power to them: they are no Officers in the Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That were to make Gods houſe an houſe of confuſion: the body all one member, all head to rule, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It remaines therefore that himſelfe in ſuch a caſe being the alone Officer of the Church, and bound <hi>virtute officii</hi> to know the ſtate of his Flock, and to take care of their ſoules, do what in him lies: 1. To warne the ignorant and ſcandalous to abſtaine. 2. That he deny the Sacrament to them if they preſume to come.</p>
               <p>That now in ſuch a caſe, the Miniſter may, and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:118834:107"/>ought to take an account of his flock, and paſtorally to admoniſh the ſcandalous, and to deterr the unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy what he can, is eaſily granted me. Mr <hi>Humfry</hi> will yeeld this, yea, and ſomething more, that he may deny it to notorious ſinners, ſuch as he cals <hi>de jure excommunicati</hi> (by which he only meanes ſuch as are fit to be hanged.) Mr <hi>Jeanes</hi> likewiſe will yeeld this, though he is not cleare in allowing to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter more than a <hi>doctrinall power</hi> to keep away any. But all the queſtion is, <hi>Whether the ſingle Miniſter in ſuch a caſe, if the ignorant and ſcandalous perſon will not keepe away, may deny the Ordinance to him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That <hi>he cannot formally pronounce a Church cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> againſt him I yeeld.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That he cannot take him and turne him out by head and ſhoulders, I grant too.</p>
               <p>The queſtion therefore is narrowed up to this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Suppoſe ſuch a Miniſter knows one to be notoriouſly ignorant or ſcandalous, who hath given no evidence of his repentance, and this wretch, notwithſtanding his Paſtors admonition of him to keep away, will yet when the day of adminiſtration comes, preſſe in amongſt the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants, whether the Miniſter ſhall ſin (if he delivers it from hand to hand) in paſſing by ſuch a one, and not giving it to him, or if he delivers it at once to all, and ſeeth ſuch an one there, and declares either more generally, that the Elements are only provided for, and given unto ſuch as have approved themſelves unto him: Or, if he thinks fit, to declare particularly, that whereas there are ſuch and ſuch there whom he hath found ignorant, or have been ſcandalous, and as yet given no ſatisfaction, he doth not intend them, or any of them, in his generall delivery of the Ordinance,</hi> I maintaine the Negative, that he ſhall not ſin, yea, that he ſhould ſin if he ſhould not do it, it being the only courſe he can take to fulfill Chriſts command, and not be guilty of giving holy things to dogs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:118834:108"/>
               <p>To the fore-mentioned Arguments I ſhall adde one more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If in ſuch a caſe the Miniſter of the Goſpell cannot ſhew himſelfe a faithfull Steward of Gods myſteries:</hi>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Argument </seg>2</label> 
                  <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he doth deny the Sacrament of the Lords Supper to the ignorant and ſcandalous</hi> (though he wants an El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſhip) then he may (in caſe <hi>of ſuch a defect in the Church) deny the Lords Supper to ſuch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But though there be an Elderſhip wanting in the Church, yet if the Miniſter gives that Ordinance to the ignorant and Scandalous, he cannot in it ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a faithfull ſteward of Gods myſteries.</hi>—Ergo.</p>
               <p>To prove the conſequence, I ſhall need but prove theſe things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That a Miniſter is ſteward of the myſteries of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That the Sacraments are ſome of thoſe myſteries committed to his Stewardſhip.</hi>

               <p n="3">3. <hi>That he muſt be faithfull in his ſtewardſhip.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That a miniſter is a ſteward of Gods <hi>myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> is cleare; they are the words of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.1.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the <hi>Sacraments</hi> are ſome of thoſe myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, is cleare; 1. By conſidering that <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> is the known Greeke word to expreſſe a Sacrament, if not the only one. 2. From that which is generally gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that none but the Miniſters may diſpenſe them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That they muſt be <hi>faithfull</hi> is plaine, not only firſt from reaſon, but ſecondly from the expreſſe words of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.2.</p>
               <p>All the Queſtion lies upon the <hi>Aſſumption:</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>That the faithfulneſſe of a ſteward, as to the dealing out his Maſters goods betruſted to him to diſtribute, lies chiefly, if not only, in this: that he gives them out to ſuch, and none other but ſuch, as his Maſter commands him to give them to.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is ſo evident to reaſon, that none can deny it but will be poſed to aſſign any other thing wherein he can ſhew his faithfulneſſe more, or ſo much. Surely any mans reaſon will tell him, that if his Maſter gives him a thouſand pounds to diſtribut amongſt ſuch and ſuch people, his faithfulneſſe lies in diſtributing it to ſuch, and none but ſuch though they aske it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is already proved, that the Miniſter is the Lords Steward and the Sacraments are Chriſts goods, committed to him to diſtribute to others.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is as evident that he hath no command from Chriſt his Maſter to give them out to ſuch as are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently ſcandalous or ignorant.</p>
               <p>Surely it were very abſurd to ſay, that Chriſt ſhould command me his Miniſter, to give out his Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to ſuch <hi>as he lets me know are forbidden upon paine of damnation to receive.</hi> Saint <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>That for ſuch as we know have ſinned the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt we ſhould not pray,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.16.

                  </note> I find Reverend and Learned Mr <hi>Jeanes</hi> ſpeaking ſomething to anſwer this Argument; two things he ſaith, 1. By way of retortion; <hi>That the faithfulneſſe of a Steward lies in going no further than his Maſters Commiſſion,</hi> and he conceives, <hi>we have no Commiſſion to keep back any,</hi> but the Commiſſion is directed to us and others. 2. He tels us, that if we underſtand by the will of God <hi>voluntas ſigni,</hi> It is not the will of God, <hi>viz.</hi> the Command of God that we ſhould keep away any.</p>
               <p>But I humbly conceive this is little better than <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. For this is the queſtion:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whether we have no command to keep away the ignorant and ſcandalous, though at preſent the Church be not presbyterated? We conceive we have, and to that purpoſe we bring that Text, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.1. where we are required to be faithfull as Stewards.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He ſaies, the faithfulneſſe of the Steward lies in going <hi>no further than our Commiſſion,</hi> that is but
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:118834:109"/>halfe the truth, for it lies in going ſo far as well as no farther. Now we ſay, we ſhould not go ſo far as our Commiſſion, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.6. if we ſhould adminiſter it promiſcuouſly we plead to go as far as that extends.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If he meanes we have no Commiſſion, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, according to ſound conſequence from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and that it is <hi>voluntas ſigni,</hi> Gods Command, at leaſt implicite, if not explicite.</p>

Mr <hi>Jeanes</hi> thinkes the Schoolemen are out in deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining that it is not, but I cannot wholly cloſe with him. Juridically ſuſpenſion is a poſitive Act of the Governours of the Church, determining the party at preſent unworthy of that Eccleſiaſticall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion: This is but a Negative or privative Act, wherein the Miniſter, not paſſing any formall cenſure upon him, but referring him for that to the Presbytery to be judged at preſent forbeares his own act of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtring the Ordinance to him, judging him in his own conſcience ſuch a one as is <hi>de Jure</hi> to be ſuſpended, and being ready to ſubmit himſelfe to any Superiour Presbytery, to whom the Party ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale.</p>

Now if there be ſuch a caſe that through death, removall, or any defect, that he ſhould be leſt alone, and have no Elders, I cannot thinke that his power of rule muſt wholy ſleep till his fellow-Rulers be recovered. So that in ſome ſenſe he may be called the Church I conceive, which is no more (by interpretation) than that he is <hi>at that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the whole ruling part of the Church.</hi>

               <p>Object. 2. A ſecond objection Mr <hi>Jeanes</hi> makes, <hi>viz.</hi> That all our Arguments <hi>to juſtifie the unlawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of a Miniſters giving the Sacrament to ſuch as he knows to be ſcandalous, will faile us in two caſes in Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterated Churches:</hi> 1. <hi>In caſe the major part of the Elderſhip will acquit the ſcandalous ſinner, then he ſaies, we grant the Miniſter may admit them. Or</hi> 2. <hi>In caſe the ſcandall be known to the Miniſter alone, and no proofe can be made, and the party will not confeſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> I muſt confeſſe theſe are two hard caſes, and the only hard caſes I know which can be put as to this point.</p>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:118834:111"/>
               <p n="1">1. But who are they that have been ſo free of their confeſſions to grant, that in cafe an Elderſhip, will contrary to the judgement of their Paſtor, and directly contrary to the rule juſtifie the wicked, the Miniſter ought to give the Sacrament to them, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell. Suppoſe one be proved to have committed Inceſt the night before the Sacrament, and ſtands to juſtifie it, and the Miniſter calls his Elderſhip and proves the fact to them, and they in a faction will acquit him, ſhall this Miniſter be bound to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the Ordinance to this wretch? I hope Mr <hi>Jeanes</hi> ſhall never perſwade me to that faith. No, but it is my duty in ſuch, or ſuch like evident caſes to forbeare any adminiſtration, and appeale from the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall to the Claſſicall Presbytery, and if that will not relieve him, from thence to the Provinciall, and from thence, if need be, to a Nationall Aſſembly; it is to be hoped that by ſome of theſe he will be relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, if not I ſhould thinke it my duty to ſubmit to their cenſure rather than profane Gods Ordinances: and wait till God reformed ſuch Churches; if the caſe were doubtfull, the matter differs: but where the rule plainly judgeth, mens neglect of their duty will not juſtifie me in ſinning againſt mine.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As to the ſecond caſe, I know no reaſon but in ſuch a cauſe the Miniſter may ſtand as a witneſſe and the reſt of his Elderſhip; I am ſure it will be more juſtifiable than for him to give the Sacrament to one manifeſtly unworthy. Therefore I ſay, there is no neceſſity urging a Miniſter in any caſe to give the <hi>Lords holy things</hi> to dogs and ſwine; we may conceive neceſſities, but ſinnings of this kind will prove our free acts.</p>

               <p>But becauſe I am willing to beleeve he thought he ſpake ſenſe, I conceive his meaning was,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That it was an invention of ſome particular men, who were of proud phariſaicall diſpoſitions, and would bring in their inventions to mingle them with Gods Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If he ſpake ſenſe, this was his meaning; and if it were, it was one of the moſt bold and ignorant ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Churches and Servants of God in all Ages that hath been heard, and as impolitickly ſpoken for his own credit; when any one, who hath either lookt into <hi>Fathers,</hi> or <hi>Schoolemen,</hi> or <hi>Divines</hi> of any ſort, <hi>Papiſts,</hi> or <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and thoſe of any perſwaſion, <hi>Epiſcopall, Presbyterian,</hi> or <hi>Independent,</hi> as to Church Government, is able to ſay, that either he ſpake againſt his knowledge, or elſe never read any of them, (the latter of which (out of charity to him) I am moſt apt to beleeve.) But if they were <hi>Phariſees,</hi> and dreaming Phariſees too, they were many of them holy and learned dreamers. And the Church of Chriſt hath from Chriſts time been in a dreame till Mr <hi>John Boatman</hi> awakened it; and we hope to prove anon that this confident Gentleman was the Dreamer himſelfe, whoſe tongue ran (like a wild fancy in a dreame) when the eyes of his underſtanding were ſealed up with lamentable ignorance of the generall practice of the Churches of God: It was bad enough for <hi>Joſephs</hi> eleven Brethren to call him <hi>Dreamer,</hi> but ſurely it had been worſe for him, <hi>the younger,</hi> to have called all them ſo. If Mr <hi>Boatman</hi> had been ſome grave <hi>Doctor in Divinity,</hi> ſome <hi>Biſhop,</hi> or <hi>Archbiſhop,</hi> or <hi>Pope,</hi> the Cenſure had ſavoured of a great deale of more ignorance, and boldneſſe, than judgement, or diſcretion; but for one who never ſo much as took
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:118834:114"/>the loweſt degree, not ſtaying at any Univerſity halfe ſo long as is required of him that would commence Batchelor of Arts, and if he had taken his degrees, had not yet been Maſter of Arts above foure or five yeares ſtanding, to cenſure ſo many <hi>Reverend Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> Learned and Acute Schoolemen, ſo many ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Reverend Divines of all ſorts, yea, and ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Churches, all as <hi>Dreamers,</hi> Phariſaicall Dreamers too, was enough to let the world know the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of himſelfe.

               <p>As for the firſt Century, or one hundred yeares af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſt, we have no writings extant but thoſe of the Apoſtles, except the conſtitution of ſome Canons of the Apoſtles, and ſome fragments of <hi>Clement,</hi> and of <hi>Dionyſius Areopagita:</hi> (who was an ancient writer but judged by moſt long after) and ſome few Epiſtles of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> who according to <hi>Helvicus</hi> and <hi>Euſebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> was made Biſhop of <hi>Antioch</hi> one hundred yeares after Chriſt.</p>

               <p>We deſire no more than the recovery of this anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Diſcipline of the Church, <hi>viz.</hi> that none may be admitted to the Lords Supper but ſuch as firſt <hi>are baptized.</hi> Secondly, <hi>Such as beleeve the Doctrine of the Goſpell,</hi> which they muſt know before they can beleeve. 3. <hi>Such as do not live according to the rule of the Goſpell;</hi> but if none elſe were admitted in <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine Martyrs</hi> time, queſtionleſſe there were ſome ſuſpended who were not excommunicated.</p>
               <p>In this Century alſo lived <hi>Tatianus, Melito, Ireneus, Theophilus Antioch. Policarpus, Apollinaris, Athenago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras, Clemens, Alexandrinus, Pantaenus, Tertullian,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

Something there is in <hi>Tertullian,</hi> but <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> hath already ſpoken enough for this Age conſidering the occaſion of his ſpeaking, it was in an Apology for all Chriſtians in his Age, and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logizing for them he ſets out their pure worſhipping of God, and inoffenſive practice.</p>
               <p>From the yeare two hundred to the yeare three hundred.</p>
               <p>In this Century were ſeverall Synods, but none of which we have any Record but only a Provinciall Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, called <hi>Conſilium Anchyritanum</hi> by <hi>Gratian.

I ſhall with learned <hi>Genebrard</hi> account it into this. <hi>Caranza</hi> ſaies it was before the Oecumenicall Councill of <hi>Nice,</hi> but in what Emperours time is not determined. But in that Councill we find Suſpenſion eſtabliſhed with a witneſſe. That for ſome ſins, if any committed them before he was twenty yeares old, he ſhould ſpend fifteene yeares in penitence before he ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to pray with the Church, and five yeares he ſhould have no more than a communion in Prayers with the Church, and afterwards be admitted to the Lords Table. This Canon may be ſeen in <hi>Caranza,</hi> p. 28. can. 16. I find the Greeke Copy thus elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</p>

               <p>Reader, this Synod was queſtionleſſe the moſt glorious Orthodox Synod that ever the Church of Chriſt could glory in. Here were 318 of the moſt eminent ſervants of Chriſt, in the worke of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, which the world then afforded. Theſe all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, that ſuch ſinners as were ſcandalous, though they had ſinned through temptation, for feare of their lives or eſtates, <hi>(worſhipping Idols, I ſuppoſe they meant)</hi> though they did profeſſe repentance, yet they ſhould give three yeares proofe of it before they ſhould have any communion with the Church; if in this time they were found not to contradict their profeſſion, they were admitted to ſome Communion, but no otherwiſe than penitents for ſeven yeares more, after theſe ten yeares they muſt have no nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer communion than in prayer for two yeares longer; here was a Suſpenſion of ten yeares for ſcandalous ſins, diſtinct from Excommunication: were all theſe dreamers thinke we? For the length of time I do not juſtifie them, nor can I altogether condemne them, conſidering the juncture of time, and ſtate of the Church then.</p>
               <p>In this Century, they ſay, was <hi>Concilium Neocaeſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienſe,</hi> if it were ſo, and we have a true account of
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:118834:119"/>their acts. In their ſecond Canon they decree, that if a woman marry two brothers ſhe ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to her death; <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>It were an eaſie but tedious worke to ſhew that this was the judgement of the ſucceeding Councils and Fathers, but if we could not, theſe were the moſt pure and incorrupted times of the Church: and ſurely the Servants of God were not all this time in a dreame.</p>

               <p n="1">1. They all generally determine, that if the ſinner be a manifeſt open ſinner, the Prieſt ought to deny it to him, (though not excommunicated) which is enough for to prove Suſpenſion diſtinct from Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication.</p>
               <p>They are not ſo well agreed in determining <hi>who ſhould be accounted publike notorious ſinners:</hi> Nor whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Prieſt may not in ſome caſes deny the Lords Supper to <hi>Occulto peccatori?</hi>

               <p>In the next place let us heare what our Reverend <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith,
<note place="margin">Calv. <hi>inſtitut. l.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 12. <hi>ſect.</hi> 5, <hi>&amp;</hi> 6.</note> and he ſpeakes plaine enough. In his fifth Paragraph, having ſpoken before of Church-Cenſures, he treats of the three ends which the Church aimes at in ſuch Cenſures: 1. <hi>The glory of God.</hi> 2. The preſervation of the Churches purity. 3. The amendment of the offender. In his ſixth Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph he comes to ſhew the method and order of the Churches proceedings in Church-Cenſures, that he doth by making uſe of a former diſtinction he had laid down between <hi>publike</hi> and more <hi>private ſins.</hi> By private ſins he tels us, he doth not mean ſuch as none know of, ſuch as are the ſins of hypocrites, but ſuch whoſe nature is not ſo ſcandalous, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For open, groſſe, publike ſins, he tells us the Church need not proceed ſo gradually; 1.

But if the offences be of an higher nature, they muſt be corrected by a ſharper remedy, for (ſaith he) it is not enough if one hath committed a ſcandalous ſin, and grievouſly offended the Church, ſhould be, reproved by words,</hi>

                  <hi>but for a time he ought to be deprived of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Lords Supper, till he hath given evidence of his repentance.</hi> — And this, ſaith he, was the way of the ancient and better Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communciation he determines that muſt be done af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a great deale of waiting, and with a great deale of wiſdome and caution, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> thou maieſt read him at large, whoſe diſcourſe is too large indeed to be tranſcribed: This is enough to ſhew thee that he is one of Mr <hi>Boatmans Phariſees</hi> and <hi>Dreamers</hi> too; (we ſhall have good company I hope anon.)</p>

               <p>What Reverend <hi>Vrſine</hi> thought may be read at large in his eighth Queſtion <hi>de Coenâ Domini,</hi> where he ſpeakes to theſe two Queſtions: 1. <hi>Qui ad coe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <q>Thoſe are to be admitted by the Church, who by words <hi>and deeds</hi> profeſſe true repentance, and who by the actions of their life expreſſe their profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:118834:122"/>of faith and repentance, but they are (ſaith he) not to be admitted who barely ſay, they beleeve all things; for he who ſaith he beleeveth, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it not by his works, is a liar, and doth in deeds deny what in words he affirmeth.</q> For this he gives reaſons, and anſwers objections largely in that Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which the Reader may ſee in Latine or Engliſh. And that he thought this <hi>Suſpenſion</hi> ought to precede Excommunication is plaine, for in the ſame Book in his fifth Queſtion <hi>de Clavibus,</hi> He determines that Excommunication muſt be uſed as the laſt remedy to correct thoſe who are found impenitent. And in the preceding Queſtion he proves by fourteen Arguments that ſcandalous perſons ought to be kept from the Sacrament of the Lords Supper (which I wiſh thoſe who are ſo zealous for the profanation of that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance would ſeriouſly weigh) poſſibly they might amaze their conſciences (if they have any) more than Mr <hi>Boatman</hi>'s ſtartling reaſon ſcares us.</p>
               <p>I confeſſe, in this Century I find ſeverall of the Germane Divines pleading for promiſcuous Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, eſpecially <hi>Wolfangus Muſculus;</hi> but they are not ſo conſiderable in this cauſe, becauſe their Judgements are alſo againſt all Church Diſcipline where there is a Chriſtian Magiſtrate.

God ſhall reveale this alſo to thoſe Churches (as we hope.)</p>
               <p>What was <hi>Peter Martyrs</hi> opinion is plaine from his common places,
<note place="margin">Pet. Mart. <hi>loc. com.

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:118834:122"/>(all of which were kept in the Primitive Church from the Lords Table, at leaſt all but their fourth degree of Penitents,) cannot be proved from Scripture. But in his fifteenth Section moving this Queſtion, what ſhould be done in reference to ſcandalous ſinners, if the community refuſed to conſent to their Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, He anſwers: <hi>Saltem id curandum eſſe, ut damnatis atque convictis, de publicis &amp; manifeſtis cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minibus paſtor Sacramenta non diſtribuat.</hi> Care at leaſt muſt be taken that the Paſtor doth not adminiſter the Sacrament to ſuch as are convicted of groſſe ſins; from whence it is plaine, that he judged ſome that might be kept from the Supper of the Lord who were not Excommunicated. And that Reverend mans judgement is not ſo clearely to be judged from his common places (which were collected out of his works by others, and by them publiſhed) as by the Book called <hi>Reformatio legum Eccleſiaſticarum</hi> (of which more anon.)</p>

The ſame courſe is taken againſt them who diſcover their profane mind by an open contempt of holy meetings. As to the manners of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall perſons, when faults are ſecret, we uſe gentle admonitions, as the Lord preſcribeth; nor is any one called to the Eccleſiaſticall Judicatory for a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate fault, (which is not conjoyned with the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like ſcandall of the Church) unleſſe he contemneth private admonitions; but ſuch as do contemne them, are againe admoniſhed by the Church, and being convicted by due teſtimonies, if inſtead of asking pardon they ſhew themſelves obſtinate, they are according to the word of God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.17.
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:118834:124"/>commanded to keep from the Supper of the Lord till they declare a change of heart. As for more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt and infamous ſins, which the Church cannot winke at, he that hath ſo offended (for an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to others) is ſummoned to the Conſiſtory; but if he askes pardon, he is diſmiſſed: but if he be admoniſhed the ſecond time, and doth not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his ſin, and promiſe amendment, then as one who goes on ſcandalizing the Church, he is kept away from the Holy Supper, which is a ſeale of our mutuall communion with Chriſt, and each with other, untill he hath given evidence of his repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.

                  <hi>Auſtin</hi> came over <hi>anno</hi> 597.</p>
               <p>The firſt councill that learned Knight tells us of, is that of <hi>Arles,</hi> held in <hi>Conſtantines</hi> time, and at his command, the place of their Seſſion was in <hi>France;</hi> it was held, ſaith <hi>Binius, anno</hi> 326. <hi>Balaeus</hi> ſaith 350. <hi>Baronius</hi> ſaith 314.

               <p>They made 22.

               <p>In <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſaith Sir <hi>Henry Spilman, anno</hi> 450. was a Synod held. He hath a Copy of the Canons agreed upon at it in their fourteenth Canon.

               <p>This is all the Record I find concerning our Churches in that time, excepting only ſome imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Records, mentioning ſome ſingle acts of Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; <hi>Monricus</hi> was excommunicated for the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Cynetu</hi> in a Synod at <hi>Landaff, anno</hi> 560. ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Synod there enjoyned King <hi>Morcant</hi> penance for murthering his Uncle <hi>Frioc;</hi> and at a third Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod there, <hi>Guidnerth</hi> was excommunicated for the murther of his Brother.</p>
               <p>But a more perfect account I cannot find.

               </p>
               <p>Soone after this the Biſhops prevailed to have the Common Prayer and Rubrick confirmed, and from thence, as to this, we may know the judgement of our Church till the yeare 1641. It is true they were as tender of the buſineſſe of Suſpenſion, as they were free of their Excommunications. But yet we have thus much in the Rubrick prefixed to the forme for adminiſtring the Lords Supper.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>If any be an open and notorious liver, ſo that by him the Congregation is offended, or have done any wrong to his Neighbour by word or deed, the Curate, having knowledge thereof, ſhall call him and advertiſe him in any wiſe not to preſume to come to the Lords Table,
<note place="margin">V. <hi>The Book of Common Prayer concerning the order for the adminiſtration of the Lords Supper.</hi>
                     </note> untill he hath <hi>openly</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared himſelfe to have truly repented and amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his former naughty life, that the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may thereby be ſatisfied, which before were offended, and that he hath recompenced the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whom he hath done wrong unto, or at leaſt declare himſelfe to be in full purpoſe ſo to do as ſoone as conveniently he may. The ſame order ſhall the Curate uſe with thoſe betwixt whom he perceiveth malice and hatred to reigne, <hi>not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering them</hi> to be partakers of the Lords Table, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till he know them to be reconciled, and if one of the parties ſo at variance be contented to forgive, from the bottome of his heart, all that the other
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:118834:127"/>hath treſpaſſed againſt him, and to make amends for that he himſelfe hath offended, and the other party will not be perſwaded to a godly Unity, but remaine ſtill in his frowardneſſe and malice, the Miniſter in that caſe ought to admit the penitent perſon to the Communion, and not the obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus you ſee our Church while it was under Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopall Diſcipline, yet allowed Suſpenſion diſtinct from Excommunication.</p>
               <p>After that Epiſcopacy was voted downe, and Presbytery eſtabliſhed,

               <p>For our diſſenting Brethren, it is their practice, when once they have admoniſhed an offender, to <hi>ſuſpend him</hi> from the Sacrament till he repent, or be wholly caſt out of the Church. At this time, in this City, is one who hath been ſo ſuſpended theſe twelve Months, if he be not lately reſtored nor Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated.</p>
               <p>Leſt any one ſhould not thinke the Rubrick cleare enough to ſhew the Judgement of our Church in Epiſcopall times, I ſhall produce a proofe or two more.</p>

               <p>From all this it is plaine, That the Judgement and Practice of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in all times, ever ſince it was a Church, hath been to ſuſpend ſome from the Table of the Lord, who yet were not Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated.</p>

               </p>
               <p>I thinke here is alſo Suſpenſion granted precedane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to, and gradually diſtinct from Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>There is only one thing to which I muſt ſpeake a word or two wherein in our preſent practice we dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from other ſetled Reformed Churches: As to the ſuſpenſion of any whom we, ſince the late Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, admitted to the holy Table, we agree both with other reformed Churches, with our owne in times of Epiſcopacy, and with our Brethren of the diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting party, we will ſuſpend none but after admonition for ſome ſcandalous ſin, and indeed this only is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly Suſpenſion.</p>
               <p>We deny the Sacrament indeed to others, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as will not give account of their faith, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the order of the Church. But we would not have this lookt upon by our Brethren as if it were a ſtanding principle of ours, or as if we intended to put Chriſtians to give an account of their faith every time they come to the Sacrament, the contrary is evident in our practice; we muſt therefore be conſidered as a diſordered, and now reforming Church. Had all thoſe Miniſters, who went before us in our Churches, done their duty, they had ſaved us our labour. They
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:118834:130"/>ſhould have admitted none at firſt to the Sacrament but ſuch as had a competent knowledge of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Religion, and ſuch as were blameleſſe in their lives, the principles of the Epiſcopall Government required this.</p>
               <p>But we find ſome of them made no conſcience of it, but admitted any body for his two pence, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not how ſcandalous they were, (ordinarily they could not be worſe than their Parſon) we enter now into theſe mens harveſts, and finding what ſlovenly worke they made, we cannot thinke it ſafe for us to worke after their rate: this made the Reverend Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly propound this expedient, to put us in order, that there might <hi>(pro primâ vice)</hi> be a review of all thoſe who had been formerly admitted, and ſuch as were found ignorant kept away, and ſo for the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous.</p>
               <p>Nay, I will adde one thing more; Had our Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops been conſcientious in the buſineſſe of Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, we had been ſpared this trouble and odium. For Confirmation was in order to the trying of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples proficiency after Baptiſme. And as none not confirmed ſhould have come to the Lords Table, ſo he ſhould have confirmed no ignorant ſcandalous perſons though baptized: But we ſee the cleane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary practice.</p>
               <p>And there was no way but this to begin any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation amongſt us, who by our way of admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of that holy Ordinance had made our Churches a reproach to Papiſts, and a griefe of heart to all Proteſtants, and by it opened a way for Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts and Anabaptiſts, and others, to fill their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations with thoſe who were our ſtricteſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors formerly, though they quickly taught them otherwiſe. And I thinke this may ſerve to ſatisfie any conſcientious Chriſtians.</p>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:118834:130"/>
               <p>Nor ſhall any, how godly ſoever, or great ſo ever, have any juſt cauſe to ſtumble at it that they muſt be enjoyned to give account of their faith; For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, that we ſtand not upon Examination, but ſhall be as well contented with a continued Narration of their faith from them, (which we are alſo ready to give to them) Chriſtians ſhould conſider how much the glory of God, and the good of others is furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by their open profeſſion of their knowledge, and confeſſion of what God hath done for their poore ſoules; and their Reaſon may informe them, that we cannot ſpare them without partiality, which we muſt not be guilty of.</p>
               <p>And now, Reader, I have ſhewed thee, that the Churches and Servants of Chriſt in all ages, have owned and practiſed this ſo much decreed Ordinance of Suſpenſion: Now judge whether Mr <hi>Boatman</hi> hath informed his people truly, in telling them it is a dreame of the Phariſees, which wiſer ages before never thought of.</p>

               <p>But yet there is one queſtion to be ſpoken to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we diſmiſſe this particular, <hi>viz.</hi> whether all theſe were not firſt Excommunicated, and ſo theſe degrees of penance enjoyned them as teſtifications of their repentance before they were admitted againe into the Church?

<pb n="174" facs="tcp:118834:138"/>the nature of their offence, they ſhould be kept from the Sacrament, till by an humble contrary walking for ſome time they had manifeſted their hearty ſorrow and repentance.</p>
               <p>To which purpoſe they ſet 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, yeares for them, we plead not for ſuch a time, but for a convenient time for them to ſtand aſhamed, and to evidence their true repentance. And though as to every particular circumſtance we do not juſtifie our Fathers, yet in theſe two maine things we agree with them, and inſiſt on no more.</p>
               <p>And for the point of examination (ſo much bogled at) it is only in order to the ſetling of our Churches, and the correcting the abuſes of corrupt Miniſters for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, who ſhould have look'd to that, to have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted no blind ignorant perſons to the Lords Table, which I have ſufficiently evidenced, was the Diſcipline of the ancient Church of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, From what hath been ſaid the Reader may judge how <hi>ſimply,</hi> or <hi>maliciouſly</hi> Mr <hi>Boatman</hi> ſpake, when he told his people, that <hi>it never entred into the heads of wiſer ages</hi> to determine for what ſins any ſhould be ſuſpended from the Lords Table.

               <p>Indeed, I read of ſome that wreſt this Scripture, and among many, divers of <hi>the Romiſh Church,</hi> they (ſome of them) expound it thus, and tell us, it <hi>may by conſequence be reduced to the Sacrament;</hi> and tell us, they are not fit to come to the Sacrament that will not make auricular confeſſion; (<hi>and it is a fond trick that is got up againe in our daies,</hi> and ſome would faine bring into the Church,) but it hath no relation at all to that holy Ordinance; For though wicked men (which the Scripture calls dogs and ſwine) unfit receivers may tremble, when they dare put their hand to the body and bloud of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; yet notwithſtanding to preach ſuch a thing from this Text, is <hi>little better than to ſpeake untruth in the Pulpit:</hi> It is not truth, but <hi>truth to purpoſe</hi> that men muſt

               <p>This truth is not once only hinted to us in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, you ſhall find it was the care of all the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God in all Ages, and the ſpeciall care of Chriſt himſelfe, not to deliver ſound and ſaving truths to ſome ſorts of men; ſometimes looke how caute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous holy <hi>David</hi> ſeemes to be, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.1, 2. he makes it one of the higheſt points of wiſdome to conſider before whom he uttered words that concerned Gods glory, and did not while the notoriouſly obſtinate, incorrigible, and irreproveable were preſent: theſe inſtead of underſtanding more would turne their backs, hate inſtruction, be ſcoffers, and mockers at the facred truths of God.

               <p>Firſt, <hi>Truths not wiſely diſpenſed, holy reproofes not warlly managed are trampled on;</hi> There is nothing men had need have a greater care of, than the honour of Divine Truth. Now this is not only hazarded by proſtituting ſacred truths to this ſort of men pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, but adventuring on, that is the cauſe they mock and ſcoffe, and will not be reproved. We by experience find it brings truth into diſgrace, makes them vilifie them, and ſlight them by a nod with the head, a winke with the eye, a ſhake of the head, and it will be very well (as our Saviour Chriſt ſaith) if there be not a ſpurne with the foot. Now, ſaith he, never let ſuch precious truths as theſe be hazarded
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:118834:143"/>to contempt and ſcorne, take not ſuch holy paines, that might be otherwiſe imployed, and more to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, it makes them look with an evill eye, ſcorne, and ſcoffe; It renders Religion odious and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous to them; they cannot ſee, or rather will not ſee or heare; but ſtop their eare with the adder; and although there be an amiable luſtre, reall excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, and an inexpreſſible vertue and glory in them, yet to them they appeare ridiculous. We have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples enough of this in Scriptures; <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> came into the world and ſpake for this purpoſe, to ſee if he could reclaime an erring Generation; It is true, his words were not altogether ineffectuall, <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and a great part of <hi>Judea</hi> go out to him, yet marke what our Saviour Chriſt ſaith, he came not eating or drinking, and they ſaid <hi>he had a devill;</hi> This was all he got for his paines in abundance, the man was mad, he was a prating fellow, he lookes like one that had lived indeed all his daies in a wilderneſſe, as one out of his wits. Our Saviour Chriſt comes in ſuch a manner as would win the moſt refractary and hard heart, and the moſt obſtinate ſinner, with <hi>meekneſſe, patience, tenderneſſe, pitty;</hi> he was ready to do every man good, none evill, he ſcorned no man, he diſdained not the Society of Publicans and ſinners (though the Phariſees made uſe of it to his diſgrace) ſo he might do them good: Marke what he gets from others, a wine-bibber, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as much ſcorne and contempt as a Phariſee knew well how to put upon a man; heare St <hi>Paul</hi> that choſen veſſell and Apoſtle of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles preaching, and the next news you heare is, <hi>what will this babler ſay?</hi> That is all he got from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Generation of men; ſuch are the ſwine ſpoken of, and that our Saviour knew before he ſaid this, therefore in his divine wiſdome he cautioneth his Diſciples, and thoſe that came after them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

<pb n="195" facs="tcp:118834:148"/>Saviours ſence, the fault is not ſo much his as thine, thou that art the reprover, and admoniſher, for he may not be ſo to another man, though he may be ſo to thee, and how comes this to paſſe? From nothing but the raſhneſſe, inadvertency, and imprudence of men, they undertake to handle weapons which they are not able to weild; many men in too ſevere han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling of a faulty perſon may render him a dog or a ſwine, uncapable of their reproofe; it is ſad it ſhould be ſo, <hi>howſoever men expreſſe themſelves raſhly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adviſedly, if it be truth they ſpeake, it is ſad men will not endure it.</hi> Yet when men be too ſeverely and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gidly admoniſhed, they may be much exaſperated, therefore Chriſt is wary in this reſpect. A ſoft anſwer pacifieth wrath, and ſo doth a ſoft admonition; ſome men wiſely dealt withall will not be ſturdy, who (if too fiercely handled) many admonitions will not ſerve. There is a neceſſity indeed of an holy earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in reproving of ſin, ſincerity, down-right dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and plaineneſſe of ſpirit in men, and yet alſo of a great deale of prudence; I know not one buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe wherein the prudence of a Chriſtian either in his private or publike relation, is ſo concerned as in this of reproofe: If you would <hi>prevaile with the dogs and ſwine in the Text, you muſt deale with them with wiſdome,</hi> and obſerve how mens tempers, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent humours are, theſe would be taken notice of, and you ſhould watch your opportunity; a mans fault may be told him of too raſhly; with what wiſdome came the Prophet <hi>Nathan</hi> to <hi>David</hi> about <hi>Uriahs</hi> buſineſſe, one would have thought it had been very juſtifiable had he ruſhed into the Kings Preſence Chamber, and told him, Sir you are a Murtherer or an Adulterer; no, he comes with a Parable, and ſo winds himſelfe into the Kings boſome; Sir, I have a caſe to put to you, There was a poore man which
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:118834:149"/>had but one Lambe, and that lay in his boſome, but the ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h man had enough, a multitude, yet when he comes to make a ſeaſt he gives his gueſt entertainment with this poore mans Lambe; this was a wiſe way of conviction, and ye find <hi>David</hi> convinced now, I have ſinned; if he had gone another way to worke, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of ſaying, I have ſinned, he might have ſaid, Thou <hi>(Nathan)</hi> ſhalt dye for being ſo ſaucy, ſo raſh, and uncivill. <hi>David</hi> might have ſaid ſo, being a man ſubject to infirmities, even as <hi>Eliah</hi> alſo was; we muſt in reproofe mind the tempers and the callings of men, this is not minded by a great many Chriſtians; hence as ſometimes they ſpeake not the truth, ſo ſometimes little to the purpoſe; and hence many Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters ſpeake and ſpend their labour in vaine.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Do not make known to all a particular caſe, for many a man will heare one man that will not heare another; and many a man will heare in private when he will not heare before another; though you are to ſpeake, yet you muſt not ſpeake unſeaſonably; a word ſpoken in ſeaſon is as apples of gold in pictures of ſilver; the leaſt reproofe, never ſo precious and excellent in it ſelfe, is not ſo when out of time; it is not fit for a man to tell another of a private offence in the market place, or being in company, whom either he is not willing to have acquainted with his crime, or however it is not fit they ſhould; thus inſtead of taking a courſe to help them forward in good, we are perhaps a meanes to carry them on further in evill; to reprove one wicked man in the preſence of abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance more like himſelfe, is the way to make them all joine to ſcoffe, and repudiate (it may be) to go about to ruine you; what a deale of madneſſe in this reſpect is the world acquainted with. It is a ſad loſſe to the Goſpell in this relation, which is the next thing; well take heed you be not the cauſe, offences muſt
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:118834:149"/>come in the world, dogs and ſwine there will be in the ſenſe of the Text take heed you be not the cauſe; it is ſad when a man may ſay, yonder is a fellow gone reſolutely &amp; refractorily to hell, when as if he had been dealt mildly withall, he might have been ſaved poſſibly, I meane in relation to thee and thy admonitions, though in reſpect of the man and his capacity it was impoſſible; this will ſadly reflect on thy ſpirit; think ye it would not have grieved the father of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digall inſtead of receiving his Son ſeaſonably, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a fitter time to reprove him, if he had ſent him away a dog, or a ſwine, if he had ſent him away damned without remedy; what ſad reflections of heart might this have cauſed? The Apoſtle gives advice to Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to reprove their Children, Maſters their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; for an ill ſervant reproofe is neceſſary, ay, and the rod too ſometimes, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaies, but it muſt be in ſeaſon, and proportion, done cautelouſly and warily. Ile adde but one more, (I ſhall put them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, becauſe I will wind up faſt) if you would not make them dogs, nor give them cauſe to repudiate. Take heed, that what you reproove for be grounded in relation to truth, and pertinent, not triviall, that makes men not received amongſt men; men take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to babble about impertinencies, and fall on a man to reprove him, becauſe he is not ſo, and ſo, according to their fancies, and their wild and haire-brain'd imaginations; and thus they make a great op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to more ſolid and ſerious adminiſtrations; when men rage in trifles what cares a man what he ſaith in ſolid things? That Miniſter ſhall never be beleeved when he ſpeakes in earneſt, who cries hell and damnation in jeſt; be ſure that it be <hi>tantum</hi> that you ſpeake, that the fault be commenſurate, and not leſſe than your expreſſions, yea, above them, at leaſt equall with them. Cure, if poſſible, by a lenitive firſt
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:118834:150"/>before you uſe a corroſive, ſerious admonition in ſuch a way gains the advantage of mens diſpoſitions. Nor let it be a heareſay, that is, a lie, <hi>fama mala,</hi> we heare a man did ſo and ſo, we heare thus and thus of him; you ſhall heare a man, ſome imprudent Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, come with open mouth, and reprove a man for ſuch a thing that hath been declared to them, and they heare ſo; this is the ground of all that uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritableneſſe, and raging among men in the world; this makes them doggs to one another, that they will not heare one another; either men talke of imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencies, and it is not <hi>tantum,</hi> whether it be ſo, or it be not, I have heard ſuch a man will keep company, my neighbour will be drunke and ſweare, when nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is true; thus inſtead of making a man heare and being well pleaſed they give them cauſe to rage in faſtning on them ſuch aſperſions as they are not guilty of: as impertinent, ſo uncertaine reproofes are evill. In a word, I bleſſe God you are not left in that eſtate and condition, not of an incorrigible ſpirit as yet, you are not yet ſhut out of Heaven; do you bleſſe God, and I will bleſſe God with you, ye are not yet <hi>dogs or ſwine;</hi> far be it from me to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie any of you in your enormities, in your ſins, profaneneſſes, and debauched courſes, if there be any ſuch, if any be found guilty of it, thus much I dare ſay to your praiſe, (as the Apoſtle ſaith in another caſe) I hope better things of you though I thus ſpeake; I know not a man among you, of an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provable ſpirit; I have not met with a dog or a ſwine that will rage at admonition, or be angry with me for Preaching, <hi>unleſſe it be ſome ſelfe-conceited Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſee, that cannot endure any body ſhould be accounted ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as themſelves.</hi> Theſe indeed barke, and bite, rage and rave revile, ſcandalize, and aſperſe.

Doth Mr <hi>Boatman</hi> think we have ſuch a reverend opinion of him as to beleeve that what he barely ſaith is the meaning of the Holy Ghoſt, that, and none but that?

               <p>In the next place he comes to tell us who are meant by <hi>dogs and ſwine.</hi> 
                  <q>I told thee,
<label type="milestone">

                  </q> I thinke this was a fair ſoundation for finding out the meaning of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor. Mr <hi>Boatman</hi> tels us, none but <hi>obſtinate and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reprovable men are meant;</hi> yet he grants, that by <hi>ſwine</hi> are meant the <hi>luxurious,</hi> (who are not alwaies obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.) But how doth he prove this? Becauſe he promiſed us to make it ſo plaine that he who ran might read it.) Not a word for that, if you will take Mr <hi>Boatman's</hi> word you may, but he hath no reaſon for to convince you if you refuſe. Thus he doth not only preach <hi>placentia,</hi> but <hi>Placets</hi> too. Surely he doth

                  <hi>This he ſaith, ſpeakes the ineffectualneſs of ſuch holy and ſavoury truths.</hi> So then our Saviours Reaſon is this, <hi>Give not holy things to dogs and ſwine, becauſe they will prove uſeleſſe and ineffectuall to them.</hi> From whence I argue, <hi>If then the Sacrament will be uſeleſſe and ineffectuall to profane men,</hi> that holy thing muſt not be given to them.

               <p>In his third Paragraph he comes to ſum up his fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,

But beſides, Chriſt muſt alſo ſay, <hi>Take heed how you do it in ſuch a way as may not make ſinners appeare dogs and ſwine,</hi> &amp;c. But where is this in the Text I wonder?

But it had no relation at all to that holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance; for though wicked men (which the Scripture cals dogs and ſwine) unfit Receivers, may tremble when they dare put their hand to the body and bloud of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, yet notwithſtanding to preach ſuch a thing from this Text is little better than to ſpeake un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth in the Pulpit,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Either here is a great deale of ignorance, or malice, or both diſcovered.</p>

               <p>I am very apt to beleeve Mr <hi>Boatman</hi> knows ſo much of Auricular Confeſſion as to know:</p>
               <p n="1">1.

               <p n="2">2. But ſecondly, we do not require any confeſſion of ſecret or more open ſins, but only that they being proved ſo guilty, they ſhould be unwilling to teſtifie their humiliation or repentance before they are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Lords Table; ſo that this whimzie

                     <hi>To preach ſuch a thing from this Text is little better than to ſpeake untruth in the Pulpit. It is not truth, but truth to the purpoſe that men muſt ſpeake from ſacred Texts of the holy Word of God, elſe they faſten that on the Holy Ghoſt which he never meant or dreampt; and it is a dreadfull account which a great many men in the world have to give, vainly to attempt to lay any foundation on a Text which is either too weake for it, or which it doth not at all concerne; It is an eaſie matter to wring a Text ſo long by the Noſe as to make it bleed againe, and all to little purpoſe; Take notice whatſoever may be urged about this Sacred Ordinance from another place, and at another time, it is not meant here, to ſpeake of it here is to ſpeake to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, not worth the ſpeaking, it is not the ſenſe of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Here he ſpeakes loud enough, and falls upon me pell-mell, but with no other weapons than his tongue; he charges me with <hi>preaching untruth;</hi> how doth that appeare? Mr <hi>Boatman</hi> ſaies ſo, and that is all. He tels us of faſtning ſomthing upon the Holy Ghoſt which <hi>he never dreampt of.</hi> (No Sir, the Holy Ghoſt doth not uſe to <hi>dreame,</hi> though fraile man may, he carries no ſleepy body about with him;) he tells us, <hi>It is an eaſie matter to wring a Text about by the Noſe;</hi> he is

And for all this you have Mr <hi>Boatman's</hi> word.

Yet Reader, I deſire thee to be of <hi>Hierom's</hi> mind, <hi>Give that honour to the Word of God only, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve it becauſe it is his word;</hi> and for Mr <hi>Boatman</hi> and me about any Text, lay our Reaſons <hi>in the ballance of the Sanctuary,</hi> provided thou forbeareſt his light gold the allowance of faction, and particular affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and let the Scale that is heavieſt carry it, I aske no other favour; I profeſſe I never read ſuch an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious, magiſteriall pack of Sentences without a dram of reaſon for his own <hi>ſay</hi> ſince I knew what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to a book.</p>
               <p>Now he is come to his Doctrine,
<note place="margin">Animadr, on <hi>Paragr.</hi> 4.</note> which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is the duty of every Chriſtian, eſpecially of every Miniſter, to take heed to whom, and how they deliver divine truths, leſt, delivering them to obſtinate and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provable men, they labour in vaine, and they trample upon them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. If this be the truth, yet I conceive it is not the whole truth of the Text.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Mr <hi>Boatman</hi> ſhould have done well to have kept
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:118834:156"/>the termes <hi>holy things,</hi> and <hi>Pearles,</hi> except he had proved by Scripture or Reaſon that <hi>divine truths</hi> are the only holy things and pearles here meant.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I hope Mr <hi>Boatman</hi> will tell us how we ſhall know a man to be ſo irreprovable, that we may be juſtified in not preaching to him, nor admoniſhing him.</p>
               <p>But I find it otherwiſe, he is loath to meddle with that nice Point; but he undertakes, 1. To prove that there are ſome to whom we muſt not deliver di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine truths.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He undertakes to give us reaſons:</p>
               <p>Firſt, he will prove that there are ſome ſuch; this he thinks he can prove from <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.2. where <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>He kept his mouth with a bridle while the wicked was before him. — he held his peace even from good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr <hi>Boatman</hi> told us even now, that it muſt <hi>be truth to the purpoſe a man muſt deliver, as the ſenſe of the Holy Ghost.</hi> That which Mr <hi>Boatman</hi> hath to prove is, that the Children of God ſhould not deliver to wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men, who are irreprovable, divine truth; to this purpoſe he brings that of <hi>David,</hi> who <hi>held his peace from good;</hi> what good? What, from admoniſhing them? There is no ſuch thing in the Text. <hi>Mollerus</hi> expounds it of his own juſt and righteous cauſe the defending of that; Others expound it in generall <hi>of good</hi> that he was altogether ſilent, not in reference to the wicked, in reſpect of whom he reſtrained his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. but in reference to his trouble of ſpirit, which was ſuch as ſtupified him.</p>
               <p>In the next place he tels us how wary the Prophets were when people were incorrigible, but he that reads them will find they never left reproving them. He tells us God bids them not <hi>pray for them,</hi> that is true, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7. but in the ſame Chapter he is bid to preach to them and reprove them, <hi>ver.</hi> 2.</p>
               <pb n="212" facs="tcp:118834:157"/>
               <p>He hath but one inſtance more, and that is of our Saviour Chriſt, who, he ſaies, would ſometimes make them <hi>no anſwer;</hi> but what is this to the purpoſe? did our Saviour ever forbeare <hi>reproving them,</hi> or <hi>preaching to them.</hi> Thus, Reader thou ſeeſt how well he hath proved his Doctrine, not one inſtance holds. Let us come to his Reaſons.</p>
               <p>He tells us,
<note place="margin">Animadv. on <hi>Paragraph</hi> 5.</note> he will inſtance in thoſe in the Text: 1. <hi>Becauſe they will trample upon them.</hi> So he ſaies they did upon <hi>John Baptiſts</hi> Doctrine, and our Saviour Chriſts, and <hi>Pauls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There needs no more than this to prove that <hi>prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Goſpell, and admonition is not here meant only;</hi> ſor firſt, the ſame reaſon will hold to the Sacrament, wicked men will trample on that too ſurely. 2. Though they trampled on <hi>John Baptists,</hi> and our Saviours, and the Apoſtles preaching to them, yet none of them left preaching the Goſpell, nor admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing them.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Reaſon is: <hi>They will turne againe and rend you,</hi> that is, (as Mr <hi>Boatman</hi> expounds it) you will <hi>endanger yourſelves.</hi> I anſwer, this againe proves the preaching the Goſpell is not the only thing here meant; for who knows not that the Apoſtles conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preached the Goſpell to the apparent hazard of their lives? <hi>Paul fights with beaſts at Epheſus, is whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, ſtoned, impriſoned,</hi> at other places, yet he prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; and the Apoſtles durſt not leave preaching to any upon any a count.</p>
               <p>In the next large <hi>Paragraph</hi> Mr <hi>Boatman</hi> makes a digreſſion to take away the wonder of the world,
<note place="margin">Animadv. on <hi>Paragraph.</hi> 6.</note> that there ſhould be any Chriſtians ſo bad. Some he thinks there are, <hi>but he hath none of them;</hi> and he feares they <hi>are moſt amongſt them who have their mouths fulleſt of ſuch termes.</hi> The termes are our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Chriſts own, I know none uſeth them with
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:118834:157"/>reference to any particular perſons, but only to ſhew, ſuch ought not to be admitted to holy things. Mr <hi>Boatman</hi> poſſibly is angry that our Saviour ſhould ſo characterize thoſe whom he, it may be, hath a more reverend opinion of; <hi>Whining Chriſtians, Squeaking out Jeſus Chriſt, The Noſes of Texts, the dreamings of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> I thinke are more Apocryphall termes than <hi>dogs and ſwine,</hi> applied to ſuch as returne (after Baptiſme) with the Dog to the vomit, and the Swine to wallow in the mire.</p>
               <p>I do not well underſtand how this came into his Sermon, yet it is a third part of it to ſhew how men by degrees come to be ſo wicked as not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure reproofe; (Any ſchollar muſt judge that it came in as the man brought in <hi>Hercules.</hi>) It is true, had Mr <hi>Boatman</hi> done his maine worke, to prove that Admonition was the only thing, or Preaching the only thing here meant, he might have been borne with, recreating himſelfe with ſuch a digreſſion, which yet had been more proper for the Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>I am apt to beleeve, that <hi>Pride,</hi> and <hi>Ignorance,</hi> and <hi>love of luſts,</hi> are the three great cauſes of mens not enduring wholſome reproofe; but what was this to Mr <hi>Boatman's</hi> purpoſe, who ſhould have ſpent his time to prove:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That <hi>Admonition, and Divine truths are the only holy things and pearles here meant;</hi> And when he had done what he could for that, I would have had ſome body whiſpered him in the eare, and told him, ſurely he was not aware what he ſaid, for if Dogs muſt not be admoniſhed; nor preached to, ſurely they muſt not have the Sacrament given them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He was to prove, <hi>that Divine truths and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition muſt not be given to dogs,</hi> and there he ſhould have <hi>deſcribed the dogs</hi> to whom the Goſpell muſt not
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:118834:158"/>be preached, and who muſt not be admoniſhed, and have given good warrant from Scripture, or Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall reaſon for the Expoſition, and when he had done that, I would have had him anſwered theſe two Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
               <p>Object. 1. <hi>If Admonition muſt not be given to dogs,</hi> what is the meaning of that of the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.14, 15.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And if any man obey not our word by this Epiſtle, note that man, and have no company with him that he might be aſhamed;</hi> yet <hi>count him not as an enemy, but admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh him as a Brother.</hi> An excommunicate perſon muſt needs be a dog in the higheſt ſence; he <hi>muſt</hi> be ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, <hi>viz.</hi> a very <hi>profane flagitious perſon,</hi> and <hi>judicial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> adjudged ſo in Court, and ſo turned out of the houſe for his dog-like diſpoſitions, he muſt be <hi>perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacious,</hi> and irreprovable, for till he hath refuſed the <hi>admonition of the Church</hi> he ought not to be caſt out; yet when he is caſt out, though private Chriſtians muſt have no private Communion with him, nor the Church any fellowſhip with him, yet they ought to <hi>admoniſh him to repent,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Excommunication</hi> it ſelfe being in order to <hi>reformation</hi> of the perſon, not to his deſtruction.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Did not the Apoſtles preach the Goſpell to <hi>perſecutors, and irreprovable men? Acts</hi> 3. <hi>Ch.</hi> 7. and in many other places.</p>
               <p>Mr <hi>Boatman</hi> tels us that Pride is the cauſe of <hi>irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provableneſſe</hi> in men, and he proves it well enough from the inſtance of the falſe Apoſtles in the Church of <hi>Corinth, Pharaoh, the Heathen, Pſal.</hi> 2. <hi>thoſe who oppoſed our Saviour Chriſt, the enemies of the Prophets of old;</hi> yet it is to be obſerved, that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſtill admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed <hi>Pharaoh</hi> till God tooke him off; <hi>Paul Paul</hi> ceaſed not to reprove the falſe Apoſtles; nor did <hi>Iſaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel,</hi> our Saviour Chriſt ceaſe to reprove their Adverſaries.</p>
               <pb n="215" facs="tcp:118834:158"/>
               <p>He tels us, that <hi>love of Luſts</hi> is a <hi>ſecond cauſe of mens irreprovableneſſe;</hi> this he proves from our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>John</hi> 3.19. <hi>Jer.</hi> 5. <hi>ul.</hi> the inſtance of <hi>John Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt.</hi> This is true enough, but it is as true, that for all this, neither our Saviour Chriſt, nor <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> nor <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> ceaſed to preach to, or to admoniſh theſe wretches who loved their luſts.</p>
               <p>He tells us right, that <hi>Ignorance</hi> is a third cauſe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.9. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. yet ſurely ignorant perſons muſt be admoniſhed and inſtructed.</p>
               <p>Thus thou ſeeſt, Reader, how little all this is to his purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Now he is come to the Application:
<note place="margin">Animadv. on <hi>Paragraph.</hi> 7.</note> His firſt uſe is (as he cals it) of admonition to perſwade his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <hi>that they would not be dogs and ſwine though men called them ſo, but endure admonition.</hi> — but he ſaies not <hi>that from all men they ſhould beare it patiently;</hi> — they may be laden with <hi>the impertinent, unſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, giddy reproofes of haire-brain'd men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Here he doth <hi>inſinuate, that ſome called his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular people dogs and ſwine;</hi> he ſhould have done well to have told them who do ſo; we ſay, ſuch as turne with the dog to the vomit, ſuch as wallow in beaſtly luſts are ſo; this I hope is true in <hi>theſi;</hi> but we ſay not in <hi>hypotheſi,</hi> this and that man is ſo; No, we leave that to the reflexion of every mans conſcience, and the Judgement of the Church. This was but a meere trick to create animoſities in profane men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe who preach the truth of God to them. I wonder who ſaid, thoſe of <hi>Peters</hi> Pariſh are dogs and ſwine.</p>
               <p>For the maine of the Exhortation it was good, but I thinke he might have ſpared telling them, he did not ſay, they ſhould <hi>beare patiently admonitions from any,</hi> for I thinke the perſon is not conſiderable, but the thing, and cauſe of it. Now they have enough to ſay
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:118834:159"/>to juſtifie their ſtopping their eares againſt reproofe. <hi>The reproofe was impertinent, unſeaſonable,</hi> he was a <hi>giddy hair-brain'd man that reproved me,</hi> and our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor told us, we need not beare his reproofes patiently.</p>
               <p>The laſt Paragraph containes his ſecond and laſt uſe directed to reprovers:
<note place="margin">Animadv. on <hi>Paragraph.</hi> 8.</note> to <hi>perſwade them ſo to order their reproofes, that they may not make men dogs nor ſwine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here he tells us honeſtly, that <hi>though men expreſſe themſelves raſhly, and inadviſedly, yet if it be truth they ſpeake, it is ſad men will not endure it;</hi> but he had told them before, <hi>He did not ſay they ſhould be are it patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> here he doth ſay, <hi>It is ſad they will not;</hi> how do theſe two agree?</p>
               <p>Though I do not thinke this Uſe proper to any Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine can be raiſed from this Text, and ſo is not <hi>truth to the purpoſe</hi> (as Mr <hi>Boatman</hi> lately taught us we ſhould preach from Texts) yet I eaſily yield that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition is a tender thing, and muſt be <hi>managed with prudence,</hi> and he muſt be allowed all he ſaith upon that point.</p>
               <p>At laſt he comes to bleſſe himſelfe, and to bleſſe his Congregation, that he had never a dog in it, <hi>(an hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py houſe!)</hi> or rather he had met with none; that may be: There may be dogs enough in the Town, yet I may meet with none of them, it may be I never regard whether they beſo; but he puts in</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Unleſſe it be ſome ſelfe-conceited Phariſees that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure any body ſhould be accounted holy as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Who Mr <hi>Boatman</hi> meanes is ſufficiently known, ſuch as through tenderneſſe of conſcience, and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Gods Ordinances, cannot ſwallow promiſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Sacraments. Theſe are the only dogs Mr <hi>Boatman</hi> hath in his Congregation.</p>
               <p>The Lord make him aſhamed with a godly ſhame.</p>

               <head>Now Reader, take the ſum of my Sermon on that Text, and of his confuting diſcourſe.</head>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>THe Text is abſolute ſence in it ſelfe, and ſtands</hi> in no relation to the former Verſes: This Mr <hi>Boatman</hi> grants.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Precept is without reſtriction: Holy things, Pearles,</hi> not this or that Pearle or holy thing.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>All the Ordinances of God, eſpecially the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, are holy things betruſted to men to give out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>There is therefore no reaſon to reſtraine the ſenſe of this Text to this or that holy thing, but to underſtand it of all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Yet the whole word of God, being but one piece, if any part of that licenſeth us to adminiſter ſome holy things to ſome dogs, we may do accordingly,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this Text.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Sacrament of the Supper, being an <hi>holy thing,</hi> it will follow from this generall Precept that it muſt not be given to ſuch as the Scripture calls dogs or ſwine, except the Scripture elſewhere expreſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us the contrary.</p>
               <p n="7">7. To expound it of <hi>preaching the Goſpell,</hi> or <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition</hi> reſtrictively, is to ſpeak without any ground, and to limit where Scripture doth not.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Beſides, <hi>The Goſpell muſt be preached to dogs,</hi> viz. <hi>perſecutors, heathens,</hi> &amp;c. and dogs <hi>muſt be admoniſhed,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.14, 15.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:118834:160"/>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>It is ridiculous to ſay, that we are here forbidden to preach to ſome, and admoniſh them, and yet not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to give them the Sacrament,</hi> the latter follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon neceſſary conſequence.</p>
               <p n="10">10. <hi>The dog will trample upon this Ordinance as well as the other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. Here is therefore a generall prohibition, from which will follow by a neceſſary deduction, that the Sacrament muſt not be given to ſuch as the Scripture calls dogs: 1. <hi>It being an holy thing.</hi> 2. <hi>As much inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded here as any other.</hi> 3. <hi>No where elſe allowed to dogs.</hi> 4. Such an Ordinance as they will trample on.</p>
               <p>Now what ſaies Mr <hi>Boatman?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>This Text is wrung by the Noſe till bloud comes, and I will redeeme the Captive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The utmoſt of the Holy Ghoſts meaning</hi> by holy things and pearles is <hi>divine truths,</hi> and <hi>admonitions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. To ſtretch the Text further is to preach <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth, nothing to purpoſe,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Admonition and preaching are holy things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>We muſt take heed how we give them out to dogs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>For the proofe of the three firſt;</hi> you muſt take my word, or chuſe whether you will beleeve it or no. And for anſwering any Objections, he is not at leiſure.</p>
               <p>Read and judge now how learnedly I am confuted. He came out like a man of war, but what hath he done?</p>
